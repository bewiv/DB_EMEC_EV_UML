The health status of PEMFC and LIB decreases with the use of FCEV, so the energy management strategy (EMS) needs to give an optimal power distribution based on the health status of power sources throughout the lifetime. However, rule-based control strategies cannot achieve this. To prolong the service lifetime of two power sources by optimizing power distribution, this article proposes a long-term energy management strategy (LTEMS) for FCEV, which contains a reinforcement learning module and an improved thermostat controller. By designing a reward function, the reinforcement learning module outputted various LIB state of charge (SOC) boundary which changes with power source attenuation. Based on SOC boundary, the improved thermostat controller will control the fuel cell current under specific driving conditions. Simulation was carried out based on different LIB state of health (SOH) and external temperature, and the simulation results were compared with the data collected from FCEV under rule-based (RB) strategies. It can be found that the proposed LTEMS can effectively reduce fuel cell and LIB attenuation, and meet the FCEV power demand.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhou, Jianhao</author><author>Xue, Siwu</author><author>Xue, Yuan</author><author>Liao, Yuhui</author><author>Liu, Jun</author><author>Zhao, Wanzhong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A novel energy management strategy of hybrid electric vehicle via an improved TD3 deep reinforcement learning</title><secondary-title>Energy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Energy</full-title></periodical><pages>120118</pages><volume>224</volume><keywords><keyword>Deep reinforcement learning</keyword><keyword>Energy management strategy</keyword><keyword>Hybrid electric vehicle</keyword><keyword>TD3</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Pergamon</publisher><urls/><abstract>The formulation of high-efficient energy management strategy (EMS) for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) becomes the most crucial task owing to the variation of electrified powertrain topology and uncertainty of driving scenarios. In this study, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, namely TD3, is leveraged to derivate intelligent EMS for HEV. A heuristic rule-based local controller (LC) is embedded within the DRL loop to eliminate irrational torque allocation with considering the characteristics of powertrain components. In order to resolve the influence of environmental disturbance, a hybrid experience replay (HER) method is proposed based on a mixed experience buffer (MEB) consisting of offline computed optimal experience and online learned experience. The results indicate that improved TD3 based EMS obtained the best fuel optimality, fastest convergence speed and highest robustness in comparison to typical value-based and policy-based DRL EMSs under various driving cycles. LC leads to a boosting effect on the convergence speed of TD3-based EMS wherein a “warm” start of exploring is exhibited. Meanwhile, by incorporating HER coupled with MEB, the impact of environmental disturbance including load mass and road gradient, as an increase of input observations, can be negligible to the performance of TD3-based EMS.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zheng, Yongliang</author><author>He, Feng</author><author>Shen, Xinze</author><author>Jiang, Xuesheng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Energy Control Strategy of Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicle Based on Working Conditions Identification by Least Square Support Vector Machine</title><secondary-title>Energies</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Energies</full-title></periodical><pages>426</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Driving conditions identification</keyword><keyword>Fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle</keyword><keyword>Least squares support vector machines (LSSVM)</keyword><keyword>Power distribution</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>MDPI AG</publisher><urls/><abstract>Aimed at the limitation of traditional fuzzy control strategy in distributing power and improving the economy of a fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle (FCHEV), an energy management strategy combined with working conditions identification is proposed.

However, there raise the Big Data problems with the increased volume and number of sensory sources of unstructured data collected from the EV equipped with In-Vehicle Networks. This means that traditional statistical analysis and Machine Learning tools are not suitable to be directly applied to analyse and interpret data. Hence, we aim to develop a Hybrid Machine Learning Model to predict the power consumption of EV trips practically considering multivariate high- dimensional data and meanwhile extract knowledge from the historical trip features for further applications. The proposed Hybrid Model is a modified Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) integrating Regression Trees (RT) to predict the power consumption of EV trips.

Accurately predicting the remaining driving range can effectively reduce the range anxiety of drivers. In this paper, a blended machine learning model was proposed to predict the remaining driving range of EVs based on real-world historical driving data. The blended model fuses two advanced machine learning algorithms of Extreme Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (XGBoost) and Light Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (LightGBM). The proposed model was trained to 'learn' the relationship between the driving distance and the proposed features such as cumulative output energy of the motor and the battery, different driving patterns, and temperature of the battery). In addition, an 'anchor (baseline) based' strategy was proposed and was seen to be able to effectively eliminate the unbalance distribution of dataset. The results of experiments suggest that our proposed anchor-based blended model has better performances with a smaller prediction error range of [-0.8, 0.8] as compared with previous methods.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Zhendong</author><author>He, Hongwen</author><author>Guo, Jinquan</author><author>Han, Ruoyan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Velocity Prediction and Profile Optimization Based Real-Time Energy Management Strategy for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Buses</title><secondary-title>Applied Energy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Applied Energy</full-title></periodical><pages>116001</pages><volume>280</volume><keywords><keyword>Energy management</keyword><keyword>Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Network</keyword><keyword>Model predictive control</keyword><keyword>Plug-in hybrid electric bus</keyword><keyword>Velocity prediction</keyword><keyword>Velocity profile optimization</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><urls/><abstract>The Plug-in hybrid vehicle (PHEV) has been progressively penetrated in the urban public transport system and seen a foreseeable fast growth in the future. Within this horizon, energy management is an enabling technique for the cost-efficient operation of the PHEV. In this paper, a model predictive control (MPC)-based real-time energy management strategy (EMS) combining a cloud-enabled velocity profile optimizer (VPO) and vehicle-side velocity predictor is proposed for the Plug-in hybrid bus (PHEB) under the intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Particularly, the velocity profile and the state of charge (SOC) sequences are optimized by incorporating the genetic algorithm (GA) with the dynamic programming (DP), giving rise to a novel GA-DP-based VPO. In the case that the vehicle can be hardly decoupled from the traffic flow, a multi-feature predictor based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Network is triggered to replace the cloud-enabled VPO to predict the short-term velocity. Results show that the prediction accuracy can be improved by 5.4% by employing the multi-feature training. The equivalent fuel consumption with the mode-switching EMS in the optimized UDDS cycle can be reduced by 14.9% compared with the state of the art. The proposed strategy is validated with a real-time performance by performing the hardware in the loop (HIL) experiment.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Yuxiang</author><author>Ma, Rui</author><author>Zhao, Dongdong</author><author>Huangfu, Yigeng</author><author>Liu, Weiguo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Novel Energy Management Strategy based on Dual Reward Function Q-learning for Fuel Cell Hybried Electric Vehicle</title><secondary-title>IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Energy management</keyword><keyword>FCHEV</keyword><keyword>Fuel cells</keyword><keyword>Fuels</keyword><keyword>Lithium batteries</keyword><keyword>Optimization</keyword><keyword>Power supplies</keyword><keyword>Q-learning</keyword><keyword>Real-time systems</keyword><keyword>energy management strategy</keyword><keyword>hardware in the loop</keyword><keyword>hybrid system</keyword><keyword>system efficiency</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><urls/><abstract>A reasonably designed energy management strategy (EMS) can guarantee the safe and stable operation of fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle (FCHEV).

A mobile edge computation (MEC) based control framework is developed first, evolving the conventional on-board vehicle control unit (VCU) into the hierarchically asynchronous controller that is partly located in cloud. Elaborately contrastive analysis on the performance of processing capacity, communication frequency and communication delay manifests dramatic potential of the proposed framework in sustaining development of the cooperative control strategy for cPHEVs. On the basis of MEC based control framework, a specific cooperative strategy is constructed. The novel strategy accomplishes energy flow management between different power sources with incorporation of the active energy consumption plan and adaptive energy consumption management. The method to generate the reference battery state-of-charge (SOC) trajectories in energy consumption plan stage is emphatically investigated, fast outputting reference trajectories that are tightly close to results by global optimization methods. The estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is employed to output reference control policies under the specific terminal conditions assigned via the machine learning based method. Finally, simulation results highlight that the novel strategy attains superior performance in real-time application that is close to the offline global optimization solutions.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Yuanjian</author><author>Chu, Liang</author><author>Ou, Yang</author><author>Guo, Chong</author><author>Liu, Yadan</author><author>Tang, Xin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Cyber-Physical System-Based Velocity-Profile Prediction Method and Case Study of Application in Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle</title><secondary-title>IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics</full-title></periodical><pages>1-12</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)</publisher><urls/></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Yi</author><author>Liu, Heping</author><author>Zhang, Zhigang</author><author>Luo, Yong</author><author>Guo, Qiang</author><author>Liao, Shuiping</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cloud Computing-Based Real-Time Global Optimization of Battery Aging and Energy Consumption for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles</title><secondary-title>Journal of Power Sources</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Power Sources</full-title></periodical><pages>229069</pages><volume>479</volume><keywords><keyword>Battery aging</keyword><keyword>Cloud computing</keyword><keyword>Energy management</keyword><keyword>Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle</keyword><keyword>Real-time global optimization</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><urls/><abstract>This paper addresses two conflicts in the energy management strategy (EMS) for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). One is the conflict between fuel economy optimization and battery state of health preservation, and the other is the conflict between global optimality and real-time capability. Inspired by the hierarchy structure of a computer, a two-layer internet-distributed EMS (ID-EMS) is developed using cloud computing and the internet of vehicles. The top layer in the cloud, which possesses powerful calculating capability, focuses on global optimality by utilizing machine learning technology and stochastic dynamic programming. The bottom layer on board, with limited computing power, employs a fuzzy controller to respond to real-time conditions while trying not to deviate too far from the global solution. Thus, a real-time global optimal EMS can be achieved. The ID-EMS is implemented on an internet-distributed vehicle-in-the-loop simulation platform whose in-loop vehicle makes it possible to test the ID-EMS in an on-road driving experiment. The ID-EMS outperforms a rule-based EMS in terms of overall cost by 6.8%, but it is surpassed by an acausal EMS with dynamic programming by 7%. These results suggest directions for the future development of EMS for PHEVs using cloud computing.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Xudong</author><author>Zhang, Tao</author><author>Zou, Yuan</author><author>Du, Guodong</author><author>Guo, Ningyuan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predictive Eco-Driving Application Considering Real-World Traffic Flow</title><secondary-title>IEEE Access</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Access</full-title></periodical><pages>82187-82200</pages><volume>8</volume><keywords><keyword>Energy consumption</keyword><keyword>optimization model</keyword><keyword>speed strategy</keyword><keyword>traffic prediction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><urls/><abstract>Eco-approach and departure (EAD) systems in connected vehicles are capable of providing the speed recommendations to drivers so that vehicles can pass through successive intersections at the appropriate instants to save time and energy. However, most of existing control strategies and global optimization algorithms for EAD systems have extremely high requirements for computational resources, which make EAD systems not easy to popularize and apply to real vehicles. To overcome this problem, this paper designs a traffic flow prediction model based on deep learning regression machine, and establishes a dynamic effective red-light duration model based on traffic flow queuing effect. To facilitate real-time update of the optimal speed, a constrained optimization model is proposed as an approximation approach, which can obtain similar optimal results to that of the pseudo-spectral method while greatly reducing calculating time. The effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm for EAD system on passing intersections and energy saving has been validated on the real vehicle under real-world traffic environment. Compared with the uninformed driver, the proposed EAD system saves 2% time and 4.6% energy on average in case that driver is informed and 8% time and 12.1% energy in case of autonomous driving.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Qingyu</author><author>Filev, Dimitar</author><author>Szwabowski, Steven</author><author>Langari, Reza</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Real-Time Fuzzy Learning Algorithm for Markov Chain and Its Application on Prediction of Vehicle Speed</title><secondary-title>IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems</full-title></periodical><volume>2019-June</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><urls/><abstract>This paper presents a real-time-capable recursive fuzzy learning algorithm (FLA) for learning transition probabilities in Markov Chain (MC) from observed information and its performance on speed prediction.

Nowadays, people often drive a vehicle on fixed routes in their daily travels and accurate speed predictions of these routes are possible with random prediction and machine learning, but the prediction accuracy still needs to be improved. The prediction accuracy of traditional prediction algorithms is difficult to further improve after reaching a certain accuracy; problems, such as over fitting, occur in the process of improving prediction accuracy. The combined prediction model proposed in this paper can abandon the transitional dependence on a single prediction. By combining the two prediction algorithms, the fusion of prediction performance is achieved, the limit of the single prediction performance is crossed, and the goal of improving vehicle speed prediction performance is achieved. In this paper, an extraction method suitable for fixed route vehicle speed is designed. The application of Markov and back propagation (BP) neural network in predictions is introduced. Three new combined prediction methods, all named Markov and BP Neural Network (MBNN) combined prediction algorithm, are proposed, which make full use of the advantages of Markov and BP neural network algorithms. Finally, the comparison among the prediction methods has been carried out. The results show that the three MBNN models have improved by about 19%, 28%, and 29% compared with the Markov prediction model, which has better performance in the single prediction models. Overall, the MBNN combined prediction models can improve the prediction accuracy by 25.3% on average, which provides important support for the possible optimization of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle energy consumption.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Liansheng</author><author>Zhang, Jiangyan</author><author>Liu, Dequan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Neural Network based Vehicle Speed Prediction for Specific Urban Driving</title><secondary-title>Proceedings 2018 Chinese Automation Congress, CAC 2018</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings 2018 Chinese Automation Congress, CAC 2018</full-title></periodical><pages>1798-1803</pages><keywords><keyword>Neural Networks</keyword><keyword>Vehicle speed prediction</keyword><keyword>individual data</keyword><keyword>specific route</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><urls/><abstract>Vehicle speed prediction plays an important role in hybrid and electric vehicle energy management.

To optimize this coordination, not only the current power demand but also the future one is needed for real-time distribution decision. This paper presents a prediction-based optimal energy management strategy. Extreme learning machine algorithm is exploited to provide the driver torque demand prediction for realizing the receding horizon optimization. With an industrial used traffic-in-the-loop powertrain simulation platform, an urban driving route scenario is built for the source data collection. Both of one-step-ahead and multi-step-ahead predictions are investigated. The prediction results show that for the three-step-ahead prediction, the 1st step can achieve unbiased estimation and the minimum root-mean-square error can achieve 100, 150 and 160 of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd steps, respectively. Furthermore, integrating with the learning-based prediction, a real-time energy management strategy is designed by solving the receding horizon optimization problem.

Accurate on-road vehicle speed prediction is challenging because individual vehicle speed is affected by many factors related to driver–vehicle–road–traffic system, e.g. the traffic conditions, vehicle type, and driver's behavior, in either a deterministic or stochastic way. Also machine learning makes vehicle speed predictions more accessible by exploring the potential relationship between the vehicle speed and its main factors based on the historical driving data in the context of vehicular networks. This study proposes a novel data-driven vehicle speed prediction method based on back propagation-long short-term memory (BP-LSTM) algorithms for long-term individual vehicle speed prediction along the planned route. Also Pearson correlation coefficient is adopted to analyse the correlation of driver–vehicle–road–traffic historical characteristic parameters for the enhancement of the model's computing efficiency. Finally, a real natural driving data in Nanjing is used to evaluate the prediction performance with a result that the proposed vehicle speed prediction method outperforms other ones in terms of prediction accuracy. Moreover, based on the predicted vehicle speed, this work studies and analyses its effectiveness in two scenarios of energy consumption prediction and travel time prediction.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yufang, Li</author><author>Jun, Zhang</author><author>Chen, Ren</author><author>Xiaoding, Lu</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prediction of Vehicle Energy Consumption on a Planned Route Based on Speed Features Forecasting</title><secondary-title>IET Intelligent Transport Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IET Intelligent Transport Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>511-522</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Institution of Engineering and Technology</publisher><urls/><abstract>The prediction of energy consumption is the primary goal of an intelligent energy management system (IEMS). Based on the actual road-traffic conditions, the vehicle energy consumption on the whole planned path can be predicted online by road condition recognition or speed sequence prediction. Because the speed sequence prediction required by the latter cannot accurately reflect the real dynamic characteristics of vehicle speed such as acceleration and deceleration changes due to the random factors of traffic or human beings, which will greatly affect the predicting accuracy, especially on the urban road with complex working conditions. Therefore, based on the analysis of the cumulative relationship between vehicle speed characteristics and energy consumption, this study proposes a prediction method of vehicle driving energy consumption based on the statistical characteristics of vehicle speed, regardless of the accuracy of the prediction of vehicle speed sequence, including the establishment of a long-term vehicle speed feature prediction model and energy consumption prediction model by BP and SVM algorithms. Finally, its rationality is validated based on the authentic data with an accuracy of about 95%, significantly improved compared with that based on long-term vehicle speed prediction.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yu, B</author><author>Yang, Z Z</author><author>Wang, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bus Travel-Time Prediction Based on Bus Speed</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers - Transport</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers - Transport</full-title></periodical><pages>3-7</pages><volume>163</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Mathematical modelling</keyword><keyword>Transport management</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><publisher>Thomas Telford Ltd</publisher><urls/><abstract>Bus travel-time prediction has attracted a lot of research interest in recent years.

Most of the existing EAD applications have been developed and tested in traffic-free scenarios or in a fully connected environment, where the presence and behavior of all surrounding vehicles are detectable. In this paper, we describe a prediction-based EAD strategy that can be applied toward more realistic scenarios, where the surrounding vehicles can be either a connected or non-connected. Unlike highway scenarios, predicting speed trajectories along signalized corridors is much more challenging due to disturbances from signals, traffic queues, and pedestrians. Based on vehicle activity data available via inter-vehicle communication or onboard sensing (e.g., by radar), we evaluate three state-of-the-art nonlinear regression models to perform short-term speed forecasting of the preceding vehicle. It turns out radial basis function neural network outperformed both Gaussian process and multi-layer perceptron network in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Using signal phase and timing information and the predicted state of the preceding vehicle, our prediction-based EAD algorithm achieved better fuel economy and emissions reduction in urban traffic and queues at intersections. Results from the numerical simulation using the next generation simulation data set show that the proposed prediction-based EAD system achieve 4.0% energy savings and 4.0% - 41.7% pollutant emission reduction compared with a conventional car following strategy. Prediction-based EAD saves 1.9% energy and reduces criteria pollutant emissions by 1.9% - 33.4% compared with an existing EAD algorithm without prediction in urban traffic.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yavasoglu, H.

The focus point of the given study is to predict remaining range in general, at first start-up, without knowing future driving profile, in terms of giving an idea of how much distance can be travelled with the remaining amount of energy. Road type and driver profile are estimated by utilizing decision tree method and periodogram of jerk trace, respectively. Based on the preliminary results, utilized decision tree algorithm classifies the road type with an accuracy over 98%. Vehicle range is estimated online by using machine learning algorithm based on experimental train data sets where chassis dynamometer tests were conducted by performing specific driving cycle in various conditions. For a real life verification, the vehicle is driven for a 50.4 km distance in a road having mostly urban driving characteristics.

Over 1 million vehicles, with different powertrain types (conventional and numerous electrified powertrains) and component technologies (advanced engines, batteries, electrical machines, light weighting) are simulated for outputs including vehicle fuel economy and cost. Despite the ability of Autonomie to predict fuel economy given various combination of vehicle inputs, the full-vehicle simulation is very time-consuming. It takes approximately 84 h to simulate for 33,060 vehicles even using distributed computing on a cluster of 128 worker nodes. Moreover, Autonomie is unable to populate a continuous output space through simulation since it only yields outputs with discrete values instead of an input-output relation. This paper proposes a novel large-scale learning and prediction process (LSLPP) via machine learning approaches to answer the need for a continuous space of vehicle fuel economy and a more efficient simulation process. By learning in a supervised fashion to discover structures in data, the machine learning approaches seek to train a model that can explain the data with which we can perform prediction over unseen data. As such, we are able to accomplish analytic continuation on the current discrete space of simulation results. In addition, we present a random-sampling-based numerosity reduction algorithm incorporated in LSLPP that reduces simulation runs and improves efficiency of data procurement. We analytically derive a theoretical bound in order to guarantee the effectiveness of our algorithm. We also compare random sampling to stratified sampling and suggest sampling strategies. A user-friendly tool is developed to support the process. Our experimental results confirm that the proposed LSLPP is able to greatly accelerate prediction and analysis of vehicle fuel economy. The output of this study is used by the US government to evaluate the impact of its R&amp;D funding on energy security and CO 2 emission as well as for the setting of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, Xiaoxue</author><author>Zou, Yajie</author><author>Tang, Jinjun</author><author>Liang, Jian</author><author>Ijaz, Muhammad</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of Short-Term Freeway Speed Prediction Based on Periodic Analysis Using Statistical Models and Machine Learning Models</title><secondary-title>Journal of Advanced Transportation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Advanced Transportation</full-title></periodical><volume>2020</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Hindawi Limited</publisher><urls/><abstract>Accurate prediction of traffic information (i.e., traffic flow, travel time, traffic speed, etc.) is a key component of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Traffic speed is an important indicator to evaluate traffic efficiency. Up to date, although a few studies have considered the periodic feature in traffic prediction, very few studies comprehensively evaluate the impact of periodic component on statistical and machine learning prediction models. This paper selects several representative statistical models and machine learning models to analyze the influence of periodic component on short-term speed prediction under different scenarios: (1) multi-horizon ahead prediction (5, 15, 30, 60 minutes ahead predictions), (2) with and without periodic component, (3) two data aggregation levels (5-minute and 15-minute), (4) peak hours and off-peak hours. Specifically, three statistical models (i.e., space time (ST) model, vector autoregressive (VAR) model, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model) and three machine learning approaches (i.e., support vector machines (SVM) model, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model, recurrent neural network (RNN) model) are developed and examined. Furthermore, the periodic features of the speed data are considered via a hybrid prediction method, which assumes that the data consist of two components: a periodic component and a residual component. The periodic component is described by a trigonometric regression function, and the residual component is modeled by the statistical models or the machine learning approaches. The important conclusions can be summarized as follows: (1) the multi-step ahead prediction accuracy improves when considering the periodic component of speed data for both three statistical models and three machine learning models, especially in the peak hours; (2) considering the impact of periodic component for all models, the prediction performance improvement gradually becomes larger as the time step increases; (3) under the same prediction horizon, the prediction performance of all models for 15-minute speed data is generally better than that for 5-minute speed data. Overall, the findings in this paper suggest that the proposed hybrid prediction approach is effective for both statistical and machine learning models in short-term speed prediction.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, Ningkang</author><author>Han, Lijin</author><author>Xiang, Changle</author><author>Liu, Hui</author><author>Li, Xunmin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An indirect reinforcement learning based real-time energy management strategy via high-order Markov Chain model for a hybrid electric vehicle</title><secondary-title>Energy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Energy</full-title></periodical><pages>121337</pages><volume>236</volume><keywords><keyword>High-order Markov chain</keyword><keyword>Hybrid electric vehicle</keyword><keyword>Indirect reinforcement learning</keyword><keyword>Real-time energy management</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Pergamon</publisher><urls/><abstract>This paper proposes a real-time indirect reinforcement learning based strategy to reduce the fuel consumption. In order to improve the real-time performance and achieve learning online, the simulated experience from environment model is adopted for the learning process, which is called indirect reinforcement learning. To establish an accurate environment model, a high-order Markov Chain is introduced and detailed, which is more precise than a widely used first-order Markov Chain. Corresponding with the model, how the reinforcement learning algorithm learns from the simulated experience is illustrated. Furthermore, an online recursive form of the transition probability matrix is derived, through which the statistical characteristics from the practical driving conditions can be collected. The induced matrix norm is chosen as a criterion to quantify the differences between the transition probability matrices and to determine the time for updating the environment model and triggering the recalculation of the reinforcement learning algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with the direct RL, the proposed strategy can effectively reduce the learning time while maintains satisfied fuel economy. Furthermore, a hardware-in-the-loop experiment verifies its real-time capability and actual applicability.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, Ningkang</author><author>Han, Lijin</author><author>Xiang, Changle</author><author>Liu, Hui</author><author>Hou, Xuzhao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Energy Management for a Hybrid Electric Vehicle Based on Blended Reinforcement Learning with Backward Focusing and Prioritized Sweeping</title><secondary-title>IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>3136-3148</pages><volume>70</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Hybrid electric vehicle</keyword><keyword>blended reinforcement learning</keyword><keyword>energy management</keyword><keyword>queue-Dyna</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/TVT.2021.3064407</electronic-resource-num><urls/><abstract>As a fundamental task of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), energy management strategies are critical for improving the performance. This paper proposes a new queue-Dyna reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm based energy management strategy (EMS), which can substantially reduce the online learning time while guarantees the control performance compared with widely used Q-learning. To solve the existing problems of direct and indirect RL based EMSs, a blended RL algorithm, Dyna, is introduced first. By reusing the actual experience to construct a model online, Dyna integrates direct and indirect RL, and thus has the advantages of both. Furthermore, two novel strategies of backward focusing and prioritized sweeping are incorporated in the Dyna framework, developing the queue-Dyna algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, it's the first attempt of adopting queue-Dyna in the EMS of a HEV. A comparative simulation of direct RL, indirect RL, Dyna and queue-Dyna is implemented, and the results demonstrate the proposed algorithm achieves a great improvement in fast learning and maintains satisfied fuel consumption.

The uncertainty of the EV charging demand is described by several factors, including the driver's experience, the charging preference and the charging locations for realistic scenarios. An aggregate anxiety concept is introduced to characterize both the driver's anxiety on the EV's range and uncertain events. A mathematical model is also provided to describe the anxiety quantitatively. The problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with an unknown state transition function. The objective is to find the optimal sequential charging decisions that can balance the charging cost and driver's anxiety. A model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based approach is developed to learn the optimal charging control strategy by interacting with the dynamic environment. The continuous soft actor-critic (SAC) framework is applied to design the learning method, which contains a supervised learning (SL) stage and a reinforcement learning (RL) stage. Finally, simulation studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach under dynamic user behaviors at different charging locations.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, Juanting</author><author>Alsabbagh, Amro</author><author>Yan, Dongxiang</author><author>Ma, Chengbin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Game-theoretic Energy Management with Velocity Prediction in Hybrid Electric Vehicle</title><secondary-title>IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics</full-title></periodical><pages>1084-1089</pages><volume>2019-June</volume><keywords><keyword>Velocity prediction</keyword><keyword>game-theoretic energy management</keyword><keyword>hybrid electric vehicle</keyword><keyword>recurrent neural network long short term memory</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><urls/><abstract>This paper studies a game-theoretic energy management for hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), combining of engine-generator, battery and ultracapacitor (UC). Each energy source has different utility function with different preference. Here, we use game-theoretic strategy to dispatch power because it can represent different preferences for different components. In addition, a game-theoretic strategy with velocity prediction (VP) is proposed to improve the basic game-theoretic strategy, ie., game-theoretic management without velocity prediction. Here, a recurrent neural network long short term memory (RNN-LSTM) structure is implemented to predict future velocities. Since the dataset of driving cycles has only one feature, velocity, two different feature engineering methods are proposed to improve the accuracy of VP. Next, Nash equilibrium of game-theoretic management has been realized through the best response functions and the performance of game-theoretic management has been carried out. Finally, four criteria are used to quantify the performance of the proposed energy management and that of the game-theoretic management without VP. A comparative analysis in simulation results validates that the proposed method gives a better performance with less battery power variation, more battery usage power, less engine-generator energy and more UC average energy difference.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, Bin</author><author>Rathod, Dhruvang</author><author>Zhang, Darui</author><author>Yebi, Adamu</author><author>Zhang, Xueyu</author><author>Li, Xiaoya</author><author>Filipi, Zoran</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Parametric Study on Reinforcement Learning Optimized Energy Management Strategy for a Hybrid Electric Vehicle</title><secondary-title>Applied Energy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Applied Energy</full-title></periodical><pages>114200</pages><volume>259</volume><keywords><keyword>Energy management strategy</keyword><keyword>Hybrid electric vehicle</keyword><keyword>Q-learning</keyword><keyword>Reinforcement learning</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><urls/><abstract>An efficient energy split among different source of energy has been a challenge for existing hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) supervisory control system. It requires an optimized energy use of internal combustion engine and electric source such as battery, fuel cell, ultracapacitor, etc. In recent years, Reinforcement Learning (RL) based energy management strategy (EMS) has emerged as one of the efficient control strategies. The effectiveness Reinforcement Learning method largely depends on optimized parameter selections. However, a thorough parametric study still lacks in this field. It is a fundamental step for efficient implementation of the RL-based EMS. Different from existing RL-based EMS literature, this study conducts a parametric study on several key factors during the RL-based EMS development, including: (1) state types and number of states, (2) states and action discretization, (3) exploration and exploitation, and (4) learning experience selection. The main results show that learning experience selection can effectively reduce the vehicle fuel consumption. The study of the states and action discretization show that the vehicle fuel consumption reduces as action discretization increases while increasing the states discretization is detrimental to the fuel consumption. Moreover, the increasing number of states improves fuel economy. With the help of the proposed parametric analysis, the RL-based EMS can be easily adapted to other power split problems in a HEV application.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, Bin</author><author>Hu, Xiaosong</author><author>Tang, Xiaolin</author><author>Lin, Xianke</author><author>Li, Huayi</author><author>Rathod, Dhruvang</author><author>Filipi, Zoran</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ensemble Reinforcement Learning-Based Supervisory Control of Hybrid Electric Vehicle for Fuel Economy Improvement</title><secondary-title>IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification</full-title></periodical><pages>717-727</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Energy management strategy</keyword><keyword>Q-learning</keyword><keyword>hybrid electric vehicle (HEV)</keyword><keyword>real-time implementation</keyword><keyword>reinforcement learning (RL)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><urls/><abstract>This study proposes an ensemble reinforcement learning (RL) strategy to improve the fuel economy.

To obtain the best power distribution between the battery and the ultracapacitor, the reinforcement learning (RL)-based real-time power-management strategy is raised. Firstly, a long driving cycle, which includes various speed variations, is chosen, and the power transition probability matrices based on stationary Markov chain are calculated. Then, the RL algorithm is employed to obtain a control strategy aiming at minimizing the energy loss of HESS. To reduce the energy loss further, the power transition probability matrices should be updated according to the new application driving cycle and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence rate is used to judge when the updating of power management strategy is triggered. The conditions of different forgetting factors and KL divergence rates are discussed to seek the optimal value. A comparison between the RL-based online power management and the rule-based power management shows that the RL-based online power management strategy can lessen the energy loss effectively and the relative decrease of the total energy loss can reach 16.8%. Finally, the strategy is verified in different conditions, such as temperatures, states of health, initials of SoC and driving cycles. The results indicate that not only can the RL-based real-time power-management strategy limit the maximum discharge current and reduce the charging frequency of the battery pack, but also can decrease the energy loss and optimize the system efficiency.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wei, Hongqian</author><author>Zhang, Nan</author><author>Liang, Jun</author><author>Ai, Qiang</author><author>Zhao, Wenqiang</author><author>Huang, Tianyi</author><author>Zhang, Youtong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Deep reinforcement learning based direct torque control strategy for distributed drive electric vehicles considering active safety and energy saving performance</title><secondary-title>Energy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Energy</full-title></periodical><pages>121725</pages><volume>238</volume><keywords><keyword>Electric vehicles</keyword><keyword>deep reinforcement learning</keyword><keyword>direct torque distribution</keyword><keyword>energy efficiency</keyword><keyword>vehicle safety</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><publisher>Pergamon</publisher><urls/><abstract>Distributed drive electric vehicles are regarded as a broadly promising transportation tool owing to their convenience and maneuverability. However, reasonable and efficient allocation of torque demand to four wheels is a challenging task. In this paper, a deep reinforcement learning-based torque distribution strategy is proposed to guarantee the active safety and energy conservation. The torque distribution task is explicitly formulated as a Markov decision process, in which the vehicle dynamic characteristics can be approximated. The actor-critic networks are utilized to approximate the action value and policy functions for a better control effect. To guarantee continuous torque output and further stabilize the learning process, a twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is deployed. The motor efficiency is incorporated into the cumulative reward to reduce the energy consumption. The results of double lane change demonstrate that the proposed strategy results in better handling stability performance. In addition, it can improve the vehicle transient response and eliminate the static deviation in the step steering maneuver test. For typical steering maneuvers, the proposed direct torque distribution strategy significantly improves the average motor efficiency and reduces the energy loss by 5.25%–10.51%. Finally, a hardware-in-loop experiment was implemented to validate the real-time executability of the proposed torque distribution strategy. This study provides a foundation for the practical application of intelligent safety control algorithms in future vehicles.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wegener, Marius</author><author>Koch, Lucas</author><author>Eisenbarth, Markus</author><author>Andert, Jakob</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Automated Eco-Driving in Urban Scenarios Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><secondary-title>Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies</full-title></periodical><pages>102967</pages><volume>126</volume><keywords><keyword>Automated driving</keyword><keyword>Connected vehicles</keyword><keyword>Deep reinforcement learning</keyword><keyword>Eco-driving</keyword><keyword>Electric vehicles</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><urls/><abstract>Urban settings are challenging environments to implement eco-driving strategies for automated vehicles. It is often assumed that sufficient information on the preceding vehicle pulk is available to accurately predict the traffic situation. Because vehicle-to-vehicle communication was introduced only recently, this assumption will not be valid until a sufficiently high penetration of the vehicle fleet has been reached. Thus, in the present study, we employed Reinforcement Learning (RL) to develop eco-driving strategies for cases where little data on the traffic situation are available. An A-segment electric vehicle was simulated using detailed efficiency models to accurately determine its energy-saving potential. A probabilistic traffic environment featuring signalized urban roads and multiple preceding vehicles was integrated into the simulation model. Only information on the traffic light timing and minimal sensor data were provided to the control algorithm. A twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) agent was implemented and trained to control the vehicle efficiently and safely in this environment. Energy savings of up to 19% compared with a simulated human driver and up to 11% compared with a fine-tuned Green Light Optimal Speed Advice (GLOSA) algorithm were determined in a probabilistic traffic scenario reflecting real-world conditions. Overall, the RL agents showed a better travel time and energy consumption trade-off than the GLOSA reference.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Yong</author><author>Tan, Huachun</author><author>Wu, Yuankai</author><author>Peng, Jiankun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hybrid Electric Vehicle Energy Management with Computer Vision and Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><secondary-title>IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics</full-title></periodical><pages>3857-3868</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Computer vision</keyword><keyword>deep reinforcement learning (DRL)</keyword><keyword>energy management strategy (EMS)</keyword><keyword>hybrid electric vehicle (HEV)</keyword><keyword>real-time traffic information</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>IEEE Computer Society</publisher><urls/><abstract>Modern automotive systems have been equipped with a highly increasing number of onboard computer vision hardware and software, which are considered to be beneficial for achieving eco-driving.

Based on the sensor records of 99 e-buses that included over 250,000 h across 4.7 million kilometers, this paper unveiled the relationship between driving behaviors and e-bus battery energy consumption under various environments. Battery efficiency was evaluated by the distance traveled per unit battery energy (1% SoC, State of Charge). Mix effect regression was applied to quantify the magnitude and correlation between multiple factors; and 13 machine learning methods were adopted for enhanced prediction and optimization. Although regenerative braking could make a positive contribution to e-bus battery energy recovery, unstable driving styles with greater speed variation or acceleration would consume more energy, hence reduce the battery efficiency. The timing window is another significant factor and the result showed higher efficiency at night, over weekends, or during cooler seasons. Assuming a normal driving behavior, this paper investigated the most economical driving speed in order to maximize battery efficiency. An average of 19% improvement could be achieved, and the optimal driving speed is time-dependent, ranging from 11 to 18 km/h.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vatanparvar, Korosh</author><author>Faezi, Sina</author><author>Burago, Igor</author><author>Levorato, Marco</author><author>Al Faruque, Mohammad Abdullah</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Extended Range Electric Vehicle with Driving Behavior Estimation in Energy Management</title><secondary-title>IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid</full-title></periodical><pages>2959-2968</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>CPS</keyword><keyword>HVAC</keyword><keyword>battery</keyword><keyword>electric vehicle</keyword><keyword>energy management</keyword><keyword>model predictive control</keyword><keyword>neural network</keyword><keyword>optimization</keyword><keyword>statistical modeling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><urls/><abstract>Battery and energy management methodologies have been proposed to address the design challenges of driving range and battery lifetime in electric vehicles (EVs). However, the driving behavior is a major factor which has been neglected in these methodologies. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware methodology to estimate the driving behavior in terms of future vehicle speeds and integrate this capability into EV energy management. We implement a driving behavior model using a variation of artificial neural networks called nonlinear autoregressive model with eXogenous inputs (NARX). We train our novel context-aware NARX model based on historical behavior of real drivers, their recent driving reactions, and route average speed retrieved from Google Maps in order to enable driver-specific and self-adaptive driving behavior modeling and long-term estimation. We analyze the estimation error of our methodology and its impact on a battery lifetime-aware automotive climate control, comparing to the state-of-the-art methodologies for various estimation window sizes. Our methodology shows only 12% error for up to 30-s speed prediction which is an improvement of 27% compared to the state-of-the-art. Therefore, the higher accuracy helps the controller to achieve up to 82% of the maximum energy saving and battery lifetime improvement achievable in ideal methodology where the future vehicle speeds are known.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ullah, Irfan</author><author>Liu, Kai</author><author>Yamamoto, Toshiyuki</author><author>Zahid, Muhammad</author><author>Jamal, Arshad</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Electric Vehicle Energy Consumption Prediction using Stacked Generalization: an Ensemble Learning Approach</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Green Energy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Green Energy</full-title></periodical><pages>896-909</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Electric vehicles (EVs)</keyword><keyword>energy consumption</keyword><keyword>ensemble stack generalization (ESG)</keyword><keyword>machine learning algorithms</keyword><keyword>real-world data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Bellwether Publishing, Ltd.</publisher><urls/><abstract>In this paper, we present an ensemble stacked generalization (ESG) approach for better prediction of electric vehicles (EVs) energy consumption. ESG is a weighted combination of multiple base regression models to one meta-regressor, which enhances the model prediction and decreases the model variance over a single regressor model. For the current study, we develop ESG by combining three individual base machine learning algorithms, i.e., Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), to predict the EVs’ energy consumption. Tackling the challenge of predicting EVs’ energy consumption, the data were collected from Aichi Prefecture, Japan, combining the digital elevation map with long-term GPS tracking data. EVs energy consumption in terms of energy efficiency (kWh/km) was estimated using several important variables such as average trip speed (km/h), trip distance, nighttime lighting, air conditioner (A/C), heater usage ratio, and road gradient. Several statistical evaluation metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods. The prediction results show that ESG is more robust in predicting EVs’ energy consumption and outperformed other models by yielding more acceptable values for proposed evaluation metrics. The results further demonstrate that the accuracy of predictive models for EVs energy consumption can be reasonably accomplished by adopting stacking techniques. The finding of this study could provide essential guidance to decision-makers and practitioners for planned development and optimal placing of EV charging infrastructures in urban areas.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ullah, Irfan</author><author>Liu, Kai</author><author>Yamamoto, Toshiyuki</author><author>Al Mamlook, Rabia Emhamed</author><author>Jamal, Arshad</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A comparative performance of machine learning algorithm to predict electric vehicles energy consumption: A path towards sustainability</title><secondary-title>Energy &amp; Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Energy &amp; Environment</full-title></periodical><pages>1583 - 1612</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Electric vehicles</keyword><keyword>energy consumption</keyword><keyword>influencing factors</keyword><keyword>machine learning algorithms</keyword><keyword>real-world data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>SAGE PublicationsSage UK: London, England</publisher><urls/><abstract>The rapid growth of transportation sector and related emissions are attracting the attention of policymakers to ensure environmental sustainability.

Li-ion battery systems require the use of a battery management system (BMS) to perform safely and efficiently. Accurate and reliable battery modeling is important for the BMS to function properly. Currently, many BMS applications use the equivalent circuit model due to its simplicity. However, with the development of a cloud BMS, machine learning battery models can be utilized, which can potentially improve the accuracy and reliability of the BMS. This work investigates the performance of four different machine learning models used to predict the thermal (temperature) and electrical (voltage) behaviors of Li-ion battery cells. A prismatic Li-ion battery cell with a capacity of 25 Ah was cycled under a constant current profile at three different ambient temperatures, and the surface temperature and voltage of the battery were measured. The four machine learning regression models—linear regression, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and decision tree—were developed using the scikit-learn library in Python and validated with experimental data. The results of their performance were reported and compared using the R2 metric. The decision tree-based model, with an R2 score of 0.99, was determined to be the best model in this case study.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tang, Xiaolin</author><author>Zhou, Haitao</author><author>Wang, Feng</author><author>Wang, Weida</author><author>Lin, Xianke</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Longevity-conscious energy management strategy of fuel cell hybrid electric Vehicle Based on deep reinforcement learning</title><secondary-title>Energy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Energy</full-title></periodical><pages>121593</pages><volume>238</volume><keywords><keyword>DQN algorithm</keyword><keyword>Deep reinforcement learning</keyword><keyword>Degradation</keyword><keyword>Energy management strategy</keyword><keyword>Fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles</keyword><keyword>Prioritized experience replay</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><publisher>Pergamon</publisher><urls/><abstract>Deep reinforcement learning-based energy management strategy play an essential role in improving fuel economy and extending fuel cell lifetime for fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles.

However, at an operation state transition, the energy overheads used for the selective ECU activation could be higher than the energy saved by deactivating ECUs. To prevent these energy-inefficient state transitions, we apply two main ideas to our proposed algorithm: (A) unacceptable state transitions and (B) adaptive training speed. For the unacceptable transitions, our energy model evaluates the breakeven time where energy saving equals to energy overheads. Based on the breakeven time, our algorithm classifies training dataset as unacceptable and acceptable event sets. Especially when the algorithm trains neural networks for the two event sets, the adaptive training speed expedites its training speed based on a history of training errors. Consequently, without violating in-vehicle time constraints, the algorithm could provide real-time predictions and save energy overheads by avoiding unacceptable transitions. In the simulation results on real driving datasets, our algorithm improves the energy dissipation of the electronic control system by 5% to 7%.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sun, Shuai</author><author>Zhang, Jun</author><author>Bi, Jun</author><author>Wang, Yongxing</author><author>Moghaddam, Mohammad H Y</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Machine Learning Method for Predicting Driving Range of Battery Electric Vehicles</title><secondary-title>Journal of Advanced Transportation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Advanced Transportation</full-title></periodical><volume>2019</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Hindawi Limited</publisher><urls/><abstract>It is of great significance to improve the driving range prediction accuracy to provide battery electric vehicle users with reliable information.

Considering the uncertainty of price fluctuation and the randomness of EV owner's commuting behavior, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based method for the minimization of individual EV charging cost. The charging problem is first formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP), which has unknown transition probability. A modified long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network is used as the representation layer to extract temporal features from the electricity price signal. The deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, which has continuous action spaces, is used to solve the MDP. The proposed method can automatically adjust the charging strategy according to electricity price to reduce the charging cost of the EV owner. Several other methods to solve the charging problem are also implemented and quantitatively compared with the proposed method which can reduce the charging cost up to 70.2% compared with other benchmark methods.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shin, Jaweeok</author><author>Kim, Sunbin</author><author>Sunwoo, Myoungho</author><author>Han, Manbae</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ego-Vehicle Speed Prediction Using Fuzzy Markov Chain with Speed Constraints</title><secondary-title>IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium, Proceedings</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium, Proceedings</full-title></periodical><pages>2106-2112</pages><volume>2019-June</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><urls/><abstract>Prediction of ego-vehicle speed for powertrain control has drawn attention to a means to improve the energy efficiency of vehicles. In particular, the understanding of driving situations using Intelligent Transport System (ITS) information can help improve the prediction of accuracy. In this study, a velocity prediction algorithm based on Markov chain is proposed. However, when various ITS information is added, the size of the prediction algorithm rapidly increases, which increases a computational time and is difficult to implement to real-time systems. To solve the problem of the increased computational power, this paper proposes a velocity prediction algorithm based on a fuzzy Markov chain. This algorithm, designed for a vehicle driving on a specified route, combines a fuzzy Markov chain and a speed constraint model. The fuzzy Markov chain stochastically predicts an ego-vehicle's speed within a constraint area and solves the problem of increasing algorithm size when adding various pieces of input data. The speed constraint model, which is estimated by empirical matrices, estimates the constraint area used in the fuzzy Markov chain. Through simulation, the algorithm is evaluated to reduce computational time by 85.5% whilst maintaining a prediction accuracy of 99.1%.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shibl, Mostafa</author><author>Ismail, Loay</author><author>Massoud, Ahmed</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Electric Vehicles Charging Management Using Machine Learning Considering Fast Charging and Vehicle-to-Grid Operation</title><secondary-title>Energies</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Energies</full-title></periodical><pages>6199</pages><volume>14</volume><issue>19</issue><keywords><keyword>K</keyword><keyword>decision tree</keyword><keyword>deep neural networks</keyword><keyword>distribution grid optimization</keyword><keyword>electric vehicle charging</keyword><keyword>long short</keyword><keyword>machine learning</keyword><keyword>nearest neighbors</keyword><keyword>random forest</keyword><keyword>support vector machine</keyword><keyword>term memory</keyword><keyword>vehicle to grid</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute</publisher><urls/><abstract>Electric vehicles (EVs) have gained in popularity over the years. The charging of a high number of EVs harms the distribution system. As a result, increased transformer overloads, power losses, and voltage fluctuations may occur. Thus, management of EVs is required to address these challenges. An EV charging management system based on machine learning (ML) is utilized to route EVs to charging stations to minimize the load variance, power losses, voltage fluctuations, and charging cost whilst considering conventional charging, fast charging, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technologies. A number of ML algorithms are contrasted in terms of their performances in optimization since ML has the ability to create accurate future decisions based on historical data, which are Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The results verify the reliability of the use of LSTM for the management of EVs to ensure high accuracy. The LSTM model successfully minimizes power losses and voltage fluctuations and achieves peak shaving by flattening the load curve. Furthermore, the charging cost is minimized. Additionally, the efficiency of the management system proved to be robust against the uncertainty of the load data that is used as an input to the ML system.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shi, Lei</author><author>Zheng, Minggang</author><author>Li, Fuyou</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Energy Management Strategy for Parallel Hybrid Electric Vehicles Based on MNN</title><secondary-title>Multimedia Tools and Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Multimedia Tools and Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>5321-5333</pages><volume>79</volume><issue>7-8</issue><keywords><keyword>Dynamic programming</keyword><keyword>Energy management strategy</keyword><keyword>Kernel fuzzy c-means clustering</keyword><keyword>Multi neural network</keyword><keyword>Parallel hybrid electric vehicle</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Springer</publisher><urls/><abstract>The energy management of the hybrid electric vehicle is still the research hotspot.

This paper proposes a novel EMS with low computational cost targeting hybrid battery/ultracapacitor electric buses to reduce energy consumption and battery life degradation. In the offline training process, by applying the K-means clustering method with 10 selected features, 16 typical driving conditions are classified. For each driving condition, dynamic programming is employed offline to generate global optimal results, which are then used in control rule extraction for online operation. During the online operation, the proposed EMS executes the designed driving pattern recognition algorithm with V2C assistance to select optimal control rules. The simulation results indicate that the proposed EMS effectively decreases the battery degradation and energy consumption cost by 13.89%, compared with the conventional rule-based strategy. In addition, it is shown that V2C assistance leads to a 6.81% lower cost.

The optimal control strategies of CAVs are usually determined for a look-ahead horizon using previewed traffic information. This requires the development of an effective future traffic prediction algorithm and its integration to the CAV control framework. However, it is challenging for short-term traffic prediction using information from connectivity, especially for mixed traffic scenarios. In this work, a novel machine learning enabled traffic prediction method is developed and integrated with a speed optimization algorithm for connected and autonomous electric vehicles. The traffic prediction is based on a hybrid macroscopic traffic flow model, in which the most challenging nonlinear terms are modeled with neural networks (NNs). The traffic prediction method can be readily applied to various mixed traffic scenarios. Information from connected vehicles is used as partial measurement of the traffic states and the rest unknown traffic states are estimated using a state observer. Then, the preceding vehicle's future trajectory is obtained to formulate the car-following distance constraint of the energy optimization problem. In a simulated scenario of 70% penetration rate of connectivity, the NN-based traffic prediction algorithm can reduce the root-mean-square errors of the prediction of preceding vehicle speed by near 50%, compared to the conventional traffic flow model. The energy benefit is 12.5%, which is satisfactory compared to 16.5% of the scenario with perfect prediction.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shahriar, Sakib</author><author>Al-Ali, A.

One of the key challenges, however, is the strain on power grid infrastructure that comes with large-scale EV deployment. The solution to this lies in utilization of smart scheduling algorithms to manage the growing public charging demand. Using data-driven tools and machine learning algorithms to learn the EV charging behavior can improve scheduling algorithms. Researchers have focused on using historical charging data for predictions of behavior such as departure time and energy needs. However, variables such as weather, traffic, and nearby events, which have been neglected to a large extent, can perhaps add meaningful representations, and provide better predictions. Therefore, in this paper we propose the usage of historical charging data in conjunction with weather, traffic, and events data to predict EV session duration and energy consumption using popular machine learning algorithms including random forest, SVM, XGBoost and deep neural networks. The best predictive performance is achieved by an ensemble learning model, with SMAPE scores of 9.9% and 11.6% for session duration and energy consumptions, respectively, which improves upon the existing works in the literature. In both predictions, we demonstrate a significant improvement compared to previous work on the same dataset and we highlight the importance of traffic and weather information for charging behavior predictions.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sagoian, Arsen</author><author>Varga, Bogdan Ovidiu</author><author>Solodushkin, Svyatoslav</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Energy Consumption Prediction of Electric Vehicle Air Conditioning System Using Artificial Intelligence</title><secondary-title>Ural Symposium on Biomedical Engineering, Radioelectronics and Information Technology (USBEREIT)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ural Symposium on Biomedical Engineering, Radioelectronics and Information Technology (USBEREIT)</full-title></periodical><pages>379-382</pages><keywords><keyword>electric vehicles</keyword><keyword>machine learning</keyword><keyword>range prediction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><urls/><abstract>Electric vehicles (EV) are considered as a solution to the problem of pollution in the transport sector.

Current range prediction systems suffer several practical limitations. Most critically these systems employ models in which all vehicle-specific parameters are required to be known. In this paper, we propose a methodology for predicting power and mission energy of electric vehicles that does not require knowledge of vehicle-specific parameters nor a drive-train model. The proposed method uses a data-driven approach grounded entirely on available vehicle sensor data. In particular, the predictive model is obtained by applying machine learning techniques, and in order to adapt to changing conditions in real-time, the specific class of kernel adaptive filtering algorithms is employed. Kernel adaptive filtering extends the theory of linear filters with concepts from kernel methods in order to construct nonlinear adaptive filtering algorithms that exhibit properties such as universal approximation capabilities and convexity in training, requiring only modest computational complexity. After providing an overview of the most relevant properties of kernel adaptive filters, we evaluate the proposed prediction methodology on data obtained in nine vehicle trial runs, comparing the performance of one linear adaptive filter, one online trained neural network and two state-of-the-art kernel adaptive filters.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Renata, Dionysius A.</author><author>Fauziah, Khotimatul</author><author>Aji, Prasetyo</author><author>Larasati, Adisa</author><author>Halidah, Hafsah</author><author>Tasurun, Dwidharma Priyasta</author><author>Astriani, Yuli</author><author>Riza</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modeling of Electric Vehicle Charging Energy Consumption using Machine Learning</title><secondary-title>International Conference on Advanced Computer Science and Information Systems, ICACSIS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Conference on Advanced Computer Science and Information Systems, ICACSIS</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>charging management system</keyword><keyword>charging station</keyword><keyword>electric vehicle</keyword><keyword>forecast</keyword><keyword>prediction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><urls/><abstract>Several electric vehicle charging station infrastructures (EVCS) have been built in Indonesia, both private and public.

These datasets are utilized to compare the effect of different signal categories on prediction fidelity for different prediction horizons within a POEMS framework. Multiple artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms use the collected data to output future vehicle velocity prediction models. The effects of different combinations of signals and different models on prediction fidelity in various prediction windows are explored. All of these combinations are ultimately addressed where the rubber meets the road: fuel economy (FE) enabled from POEMS. FE optimization is performed using Model Predictive Control (MPC) with a Dynamic Programming (DP) optimizer. FE improvements from MPC control at various prediction time horizons are compared to that of full-cycle DP. All FE results are determined using high-fidelity simulations of an Autonomie 2010 Toyota Prius model. The full-cycle DP POEMS provides the theoretical upper limit on fuel economy (FE) improvement achievable with POEMS but is not currently practical for real-world implementation. Perfect prediction MPC (PP-MPC) represents the upper limit of FE improvement practically achievable with POEMS. Real-Prediction MPC (RP-MPC) can provide nearly equivalent FE improvement when used with high-fidelity predictions. Constant-Velocity MPC (CV-MPC) uses a constant speed prediction and serves as a “null” POEMS. Results showed that RP-MPC, enabled by high-fidelity ego future speed prediction, led to significant FE improvement over baseline nearly matching that of PP-MPC.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Qi, Chunyang</author><author>Zhu, Yiwen</author><author>Song, Chuanxue</author><author>Yan, Guangfu</author><author>Xiao, Feng</author><author>Da wang</author><author>Zhang, Xu</author><author>Cao, Jingwei</author><author>Song, Shixin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hierarchical reinforcement learning based energy management strategy for hybrid electric vehicle</title><secondary-title>Energy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Energy</full-title></periodical><pages>121703</pages><volume>238</volume><keywords><keyword>Deep reinforcement learning</keyword><keyword>Energy management</keyword><keyword>Hierarchical reinforcement learning</keyword><keyword>Hybrid electric vehicle</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><publisher>Pergamon</publisher><urls/><abstract>As the core technology of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), energy management strategy directly affects the fuel consumption of vehicles.

At present, some problems in the application of reinforcement learning to energy management control still exist, including sparse reward, convergence speed, generalization ability, etc. This paper proposes a self-supervised reinforcement learning method based on a Deep Q-learning approach for fuel-saving optimization of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV). First, a detailed vehicle powertrain model of the Prius is built. Second, we use the self-supervised learning model to enrich the reward function. The reward function consists of two parts: internal and external rewards. Finally, to prevent the self-supervised model from falling into the “self-good” situation, a reinforcement learning calibration method is proposed. The vehicle exploration method is more effective because of the enrichment of the reward function. Furthermore, following the characteristics of self-supervised learning, we have also constructed a new driving cycle to verify the generalization ability. Results show that our proposed deep reinforcement learning method based on self-supervised and learning calibration realizes faster training convergence and lower fuel consumption than the traditional policy, and its fuel economy can reach approximately the global optimum under our new driving cycle.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Qi, Chunyang</author><author>Song, Chuanxue</author><author>Xiao, Feng</author><author>Song, Shixin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Generalization ability of hybrid electric vehicle energy management strategy based on reinforcement learning method</title><secondary-title>Energy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Energy</full-title></periodical><pages>123826</pages><volume>250</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2022</year></dates><publisher>Pergamon</publisher><urls/></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pokharel, Sugam</author><author>Sah, Pradip</author><author>Ganta, Deepak</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Improved Prediction of Total Energy Consumption and Feature Analysis in Electric Vehicles Using Machine Learning and Shapley Additive Explanations Method</title><secondary-title>World Electric Vehicle Journal 2021, Vol. 12, Page 94</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>World Electric Vehicle Journal 2021, Vol. 12, Page 94</full-title></periodical><pages>94</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>SHAP</keyword><keyword>SVR</keyword><keyword>XGBoost</keyword><keyword>electric vehicles</keyword><keyword>machine learning</keyword><keyword>vehicle parameters</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute</publisher><urls/><abstract>Electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as the green energy alternative for conventional vehicles. While various governments promote EVs, people feel “range anxiety” because of their limited driving range or charge capacity. A limited number of charging stations are available, which results in a strong demand for predicting energy consumed by EVs. In this paper, machine learning (ML) models such as multiple linear regression (MLR), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and support vector regression (SVR) were used to investigate the total energy consumption (TEC) by the EVs. The independent variables used for the study include changing real-life situations or external parameters, such as trip distance, tire type, driving style, power, odometer reading, EV model, city, motorway, country roads, air conditioning, and park heating. We compared the ML models’ performance along with the error analysis. A pairwise correlation study showed that trip distance has a high correlation coefficient (0.87) with TEC. XGBoost had better prediction accuracy (~92%) or R2 (0.92). Trip distance, power, heating, and odometer reading were the most important features influencing the TEC, identified using the shapley additive explanations method.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Petkevicius, Linas</author><author>Saltenis, Simonas</author><author>Civilis, Alminas</author><author>Torp, Kristian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Probabilistic Deep Learning for Electric-Vehicle Energy-Use Prediction</title><secondary-title>ACM International Conference Proceeding Series</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ACM International Conference Proceeding Series</full-title></periodical><pages>85-95</pages><keywords><keyword>Deep neural network</keyword><keyword>E-Vehicle energy consumption</keyword><keyword>Probabilistic model</keyword><keyword>Sequential data</keyword><keyword>Spatio-Temporal data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Association for Computing Machinery</publisher><urls/><abstract>The continued spread of electric vehicles raises new challenges for the supporting digital infrastructure. For example, long-distance route planning for such vehicles relies on the prediction of both the expected travel time as well as energy use. We envision a two-Tier architecture to produce such predictions. First, a routing and travel-Time-prediction subsystem generates a suggested route and predicts how the speed will vary along the route. Next, the expected energy use is predicted from the speed profile and other contextual characteristics, such as weather information and slope. To this end, the paper proposes deep-learning models that are built from EV tracking data. First, as the speed profile of a route is one of the main predictors for energy use, different simple ways to build speed profiles are explored. Next, eight different deep-learning models for energy-use prediction are proposed. Four of the models are probabilistic in that they predict not a single-point estimate but parameters of a probability distribution of energy use on the route. This is particularly relevant when predicting EV energy use, which is highly sensitive to many input characteristics and, thus, can hardly be predicted precisely. Extensive experiments with two real-world EV tracking datasets validate the proposed methods. The code for this research has been made available on GitHub.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pei, Jia Zheng</author><author>Su, Yi Xin</author><author>Zhang, Dan Hong</author><author>Qi, Yue</author><author>Leng, Zhi Wen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Velocity Forecasts Using a Combined Deep Learning Model In Hybrid Electric Vehicles with V2V and V2I Communication</title><secondary-title>Science China Technological Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science China Technological Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>55-64</pages><volume>63</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>deep belief network</keyword><keyword>long short-term memory</keyword><keyword>model predictive control</keyword><keyword>restricted Boltzmann machines</keyword><keyword>vehicle velocity prediction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Springer Verlag</publisher><urls/><abstract>Vehicle velocity forecast is an important clue in improving the performance of energy management in hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). This paper presents a new combined model for predicting vehicle's velocity time series. The main features of the model are to combine the feature extraction capability of deep restricted Boltzmann machines (DBM) and sequence pattern predicting capability of bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM). Hence, the model is named as DBMBLSTM. In addition, the DRMBLSTM model utilizes the vehicle driving information and roadside infrastructure information provided respectively through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication channels to predict vehicle velocity at various length of prediction horizon. Furthermore, the predictions results of this study are compared with the state of the art of vehicle velocity forecasts. The root mean square error (RMSE) is used as an evaluation criteria of predictions accuracy. Finally, these compared prediction model are applied in model predictive control (MPC) energy management strategy for the verifications of fuel economy improvement of a HEV. Simulation results confirm that the proposed combined deep learning model performs better than other five prediction methods. Therefore, it is a means of arriving at a reliable forecast model for HEV.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Park, Jungme</author><author>Murphey, Yi Lu</author><author>McGee, Ryan</author><author>Kristinsson, Jóhannes G</author><author>Kuang, Ming L</author><author>Phillips, Anthony M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Intelligent Trip Modeling for The Prediction of an Origin-Destination Traveling Speed Profile</title><secondary-title>IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>1039-1053</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Neural networks (NNs)</keyword><keyword>speed profile prediction</keyword><keyword>traffic data</keyword><keyword>trip modeling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><urls/><abstract>Accurate prediction of the traffic information in real time such as flow, density, speed, and travel time has important applications in many areas, including intelligent traffic control systems, optimizing vehicle operations, and the routing selection for individual drivers on the road. This is also a challenging problem due to dynamic changes of traffic states by many uncertain factors along a traveling route. In this paper, we present an Intelligent Trip Modeling System (ITMS) that was developed using machine learning to predict the traveling speed profile for a selected route based on the traffic information available at the trip starting time. The ITMS contains neural networks to predict short-term traffic speed based on the traveling day of the week, the traffic congestion levels at the sensor locations along the route, and the traveling time and distances to reach individual sensor locations. The ITMS was trained and evaluated by using ten months of traffic data provided by the California Freeway Performance Measurement System along a California Interstate I-405 route that is 26 mi long and contains 52 traffic sensors. The ITMS was also evaluated by the traffic data acquired from a 32-mi-long freeway section in the state of Michigan. Experimental results show that the proposed system, i.e., ITMS, has the capability of providing accurate predictions of dynamic traffic changes and traveling speed at the beginning of a trip and can generalize well to prediction of speed profiles on the freeway routes other than the routes the system was trained on. ©2000-2011 IEEE.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Park, Jungme</author><author>Murphey, Yi Lu</author><author>Kristinsson, Johannes</author><author>McGee, Ryan</author><author>Kuang, Ming</author><author>Phillips, Tony</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Intelligent Speed Profile Prediction on Urban Traffic Networks with Machine Learning</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><urls/><abstract>Accurate prediction of traffic information such as flow, density, speed, and travel time is an important component for traffic control systems and optimizing vehicle operation.

This paper presents a methodology for inferring road type and traffic congestion (RTTC) levels from available onboard vehicle data and then using this information for improved vehicle power management. A machine-learning algorithm has been developed to learn the critical knowledge about fuel efficiency on 11 facility-specific drive cycles representing different road types and traffic congestion levels, as well as a neural learning algorithm for the training of a neural network to predict the RTTC level. An online University of Michigan-Dearborn intelligent power controller (UMD-IPC) applies this knowledge to real-time vehicle power control to achieve improved fuel efficiency. UMD-IPC has been fully implemented in a conventional (nonhybrid) vehicle model in the powertrain systems analysis toolkit (PSAT) environment. Simulations conducted on the standard drive cycles provided by the PSAT show that the performance of the UMD-IPC algorithm is very close to the offline controller that is generated using a dynamic programming optimization approach. Furthermore, UMD-IPC gives improved fuel consumption in a conventional vehicle, alternating neither the vehicle structure nor its components. ©2009 IEEE.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Murphey, Yi Lu</author><author>Park, Jungme</author><author>Chen, Zhihang</author><author>Kuang, Ming L.</author><author>Masrur, M.

However, the EMS with global optimization capabilities often relies on prior knowledge of operation condition, which is often difficult in practice. Furthermore, with the increasing promotion of machine learning technology, reinforcement learning has been introduced into the research field of hybrid system EMS. Algorithms such as Q-learning and Deep Q Network have been extensively studied. However, the above algorithms have inherent defects of overestimation problem, which will lead to the problems of instability and poor performance. In order to overcome the above problems and save the overall energy consumptions, this paper proposes to adopt Double Q-learning algorithm to design the EMS of a fuel cell hybrid system.

In the field of electromobility, it represents the most dynamic parameter for efficient online in-vehicle energy management. However, vehicles' speed forecasting is a challenging task, because its estimation is closely related to various features, which can be classified into two categories, endogenous and exogenous features. Endogenous features represent electric vehicles' characteristics, whereas exogenous ones represent its surrounding context, such as traffic, weather, and road conditions. In this paper, a speed forecasting method based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is introduced. The LSTM model training is performed upon a dataset collected from a traffic simulator based on real-world data representing urban itineraries. The proposed models are generated for univariate and multivariate scenarios and are assessed in terms of accuracy for speed forecasting. Simulation results show that the multivariate model outperforms the univariate model for short- and long-term forecasting.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Maino, Claudio</author><author>Misul, Daniela</author><author>Di Mauro, Alessandro</author><author>Spessa, Ezio</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Deep Neural Network Based Model for the Prediction of Hybrid Electric Vehicles Carbon Dioxide Emissions</title><secondary-title>Energy and AI</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Energy and AI</full-title></periodical><pages>100073</pages><volume>5</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier BV</publisher><urls/></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ma, Xiaolei</author><author>Miao, Ran</author><author>Wu, Xinkai</author><author>Liu, Xianglong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Examining Influential Factors on the Energy Consumption of Electric and Diesel Buses: A Data-Driven Analysis of Large-Scale Public Transit Network in Beijing</title><secondary-title>Energy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Energy</full-title></periodical><pages>119196</pages><volume>216</volume><keywords><keyword>Diesel bus</keyword><keyword>Electric bus</keyword><keyword>Energy consumption</keyword><keyword>Gradient boosting regression tree</keyword><keyword>Public transit network</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><urls/><abstract>Switching from diesel-powered to battery-powered buses has been a global tendency. Traditional approaches rely on standard driving cycles or fuel economy data for energy consumption on a limited number of buses; thus, expanding to large bus fleets at the city level has become challenging. This study uses high-resolution GPS and smart card transaction data to generate each bus driving profile and weight dynamics in a large-scale transit network. Two vehicle activity-based energy consumption models are adopted and calibrated for diesel bus (DB) and electric bus by using the field data of 630 bus routes in Beijing. The average energy consumptions of DBs and electric buses are 43.5 and 14.1 L/100 km, respectively. A gradient boosting regression tree algorithm is presented to examine and rank distinct influential factors on the energy consumption of DBs and electric buses. Heterogenous behaviors are identified: the leading attributes affecting the energy consumption of electric buses and DBs are route characteristics and operational condition, respectively. After computing, the total energy conservation of electrifying all bus fleets is equivalent to 0.87% of daily electricity demand in Beijing. These findings set a good base for further studies on bus fleet replacement, charging infrastructure deployment, and electrified route prioritization.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Yonggang</author><author>Li, Jie</author><author>Gao, Jun</author><author>Lei, Zhenzhen</author><author>Zhang, Yuanjian</author><author>Chen, Zheng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prediction of Vehicle Driving Conditions with Incorporation of Stochastic Forecasting and Machine Learning and a Case Study in Energy Management of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles</title><secondary-title>Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing</full-title></periodical><pages>107765</pages><volume>158</volume><keywords><keyword>Driving condition prediction</keyword><keyword>Energy management</keyword><keyword>Markov chain</keyword><keyword>Neural network</keyword><keyword>Principal component analysis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Academic Press</publisher><urls/><abstract>Prediction of short-term future driving conditions can contribute to energy management of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and subsequent improvement of their fuel economy. In this study, a fused short-term forecasting model for driving conditions is established by incorporating the stochastic forecasting and machine learning. The Markov chain is applied to calculate the transition probability of historical driving data, by which the stochastic prediction is conducted based on the Monte Carlo algorithm. Then, a neural network is employed to learn the current driving information and main knowledge after the simplified correlation of characteristic parameters, and meanwhile the genetic algorithm is adopted to optimize the initial weight and thresholds of networks. Finally, the short-term velocity prediction is achieved by combining them, and the overall performance is evaluated by four typical criteria. Simulation results indicate that the proposed fusion algorithm outperforms the single Markov model, the radial basis function neural network and the back propagation neural network with respect to the prediction precision and the difference distribution between expectation and prediction values. In addition, a case study is conducted by applying the built prediction algorithm in energy management of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, and simulation results highlight that the proposed algorithm can supply preferable velocity prediction, thereby facilitating improvement of the operating economy of the vehicle.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Yang</author><author>Zhang, Qi</author><author>Lyu, Cheng</author><author>Liu, Zhiyuan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modelling the energy consumption of electric vehicles under uncertain and small data conditions</title><secondary-title>Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice</full-title></periodical><pages>313-328</pages><volume>154</volume><keywords><keyword>Data augmentation</keyword><keyword>Energy consumption</keyword><keyword>Ensemble strategy</keyword><keyword>Test time augmentation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Pergamon</publisher><urls/><abstract>This study models the energy consumption of electric vehicles (EVs) under uncertain and small data conditions by combining the machine learning method and the idea of controlled experiments. We propose a Machine Learning-Control Variable model, termed the MLCV model, to estimate the trip energy consumption of EVs. Different data augmentation methods, ensemble methods, sampling factors are adopted as the parameters of the proposed method. Through parameter search, the accuracy of the base learner can be further improved. Our method utilizes real driving behaviours that are generated by real drivers and collected in a complex urban environment, making the approach generalizable.

The design procedure starts with modeling the parallel HEV as a systematic control-oriented model and defining a cost function. Fuzzy encoding and nearest neighbor approaches are proposed to achieve velocity prediction, and a finite-state Markov chain is exploited to learn transition probabilities of power demand. To determine the optimal control behaviors and power distribution between two energy sources, a novel RL-based energy management strategy is introduced. For comparison purposes, the two velocity prediction processes are examined by RL using the same realistic driving cycle.

In recent years, with the emergence of rich traffic data and the development of deep learning technologies, neural networks have been widely used in short-term traffic forecasting. Among them, the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), especially the Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) shows the excellent ability of time-series tasks. To improve the prediction accuracy of the LSTM, some research uses the spatial–temporal matrix or Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract the spatial features of the data for the LSTM network to use. In this article, we propose an attention CNN to predict traffic speed. The model uses three-dimensional data matrices constructed by traffic flow, speed, and occupancy. The spatial–temporal features extraction and the attention models are all performed by the convolution unit. Experiments on traffic data at 15-minute intervals show that the proposed algorithm has considerable advantages in predicting tasks compared to other commonly used algorithms, and the proposed algorithm has an improvement effect for cases with missing data. At the same time, by visualizing the weights generated by the attention model, we can see the influence of different spatial–temporal data on the forecasting task.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Kuan</author><author>Asher, Zachary</author><author>Gong, Xun</author><author>Huang, Mike</author><author>Kolmanovsky, Ilya</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vehicle Velocity Prediction and Energy Management Strategy Part 1: Deterministic and Stochastic Vehicle Velocity Prediction Using Machine Learning</title><secondary-title>SAE Technical Papers</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SAE Technical Papers</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>SAE International</publisher><urls/><abstract>There is a pressing need to develop accurate and robust approaches for predicting vehicle speed to enhance fuel economy/energy efficiency, drivability and safety of automotive vehicles. This paper details outcomes of research into various methods for the prediction of vehicle velocity. The focus is on short-term predictions over 1 to 10 second prediction horizon. Such short-term predictions can be integrated into a hybrid electric vehicle energy management strategy and have the potential to improve HEV energy efficiency. Several deterministic and stochastic models are considered in this paper for prediction of future vehicle velocity. Deterministic models include an Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) model, a Nonlinear Auto-Regressive with eXternal input (NARX) shallow neural network and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep neural network. Stochastic models include a Markov Chain (MC) model and a Conditional Linear Gaussian (CLG) model. To derive the prediction models, numerous data inputs are used, including internal vehicle data (CAN bus information) and external vehicle data (radar and V2I information). Two data sets representative of real world driving in Ann Arbor, Michigan are used for model development and validation. One of these data sets reflects highway-focused single-car driving, and the other one is representative of a mixed highway/urban three-car connected driving. Time shift, a novel index which reflects the time lag between predicted and actual vehicle speed values, is introduced to assess the prediction accuracy of vehicle velocity. Also, a more standard Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric is used to evaluate the prediction results. In order to improve the vehicle speed prediction accuracy, data augmentation with additional labels is used to cue machine learners on different features present in the driving trajectories. The results show that these artificially augmented labels can significantly improve the prediction accuracy both in terms of MAE and time shift metrics. The results also indicate that deterministic models can provide more accurate performance on average while stochastic models may be less accurate in terms of the average velocity prediction but provide information on the prediction error distribution which can be exploited in stochastic and scenario based model predictive control. Overall, LSTM deep neural networks have been able to achieve the best accuracy in predicting vehicle velocity. For 10 sec ahead vehicle velocity prediction, the LSTM model demonstrates prediction accuracy with MAE of about 1 m/s and time shift of 0 to 4 seconds. The results also suggest substantial benefits in using external vehicle data, indicative of the current traffic situation, for vehicle speed prediction.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lin, Yuan</author><author>McPhee, John</author><author>Azad, Nasser L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Co-Optimization of On-Ramp Merging and Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle Power Split Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><secondary-title>IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>6958 - 6968</pages><volume>71</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Autonomous driving</keyword><keyword>Deep Reinforcement Learning</keyword><keyword>Index Terms-Autonomous Driving</keyword><keyword>On-Ramp Merging</keyword><keyword>Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles</keyword><keyword>deep reinforcement learning</keyword><keyword>on-ramp merging</keyword><keyword>plug-in hybrid electric vehicles</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><urls/><abstract>Current research on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for automated on-ramp merging neglects vehicle powertrain and dynamics. This work considers automated on-ramp merging for a power-split Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV), the 2015 Toyota Prius Plug-In, using DRL. The on-ramp merging control and the PHEV energy management are co-optimized such that the DRL policy directly outputs the power split between the engine and the electric motor. The testing results show that DRL can be successfully used for co-optimization, leading to collision-free on-ramp merging. When compared with sequential approaches wherein the upper-level on-ramp merging control and the lower-level PHEV energy management are performed independently and in sequence, we found that co-optimization results in economic but jerky on-ramp merging while sequential approaches may result in collisions due to neglecting powertrain power limit constraints in designing the upper-level on-ramp merging controller.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lin, Xinyou</author><author>Zhou, Kuncheng</author><author>Mo, Liping</author><author>Li, Hailin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Intelligent Energy Management Strategy Based on an Improved Reinforcement Learning Algorithm With Exploration Factor for a Plug-in PHEV</title><secondary-title>IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Batteries</keyword><keyword>Energy management</keyword><keyword>Engines</keyword><keyword>Hybrid electric vehicle</keyword><keyword>Hybrid electric vehicles</keyword><keyword>Real-time systems</keyword><keyword>State of charge</keyword><keyword>Torque</keyword><keyword>energy management strategy</keyword><keyword>reinforcement learning algorithm</keyword><keyword>self-adaptive exploration factor.</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><urls/><abstract>An intelligent energy management strategy (EMS) based on an improved Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm is developed to enhance the adaptability of the EMS and to further improve the fuel efficiency of a Plug-in Parallel Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV). Both the numerical model and the energy management strategy of a plug-in PHEV are described. The improved RL with Q-learning algorithm is implemented to acquire the optimal control strategies for improving fuel economy. The Markov Chain is employed to calculate the Transition Probability Matrix of the required power. A Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence rate is designed to activate the update of EMS, when a new corresponding driving cycle is expected. An Exploration Factor (EF) is proposed to overcome the disadvantages of the normal RL algorithm in convergence rate and reward cost evaluation. The diverse KL divergence rates are examined to seek optimal solutions. The normal-RL strategy, rule-based strategy, and dynamic programming strategy are implemented as benchmark strategies to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

Passenger transport operators are being encouraged to replace traditional buses with electric buses, to increase their use in urban transportation. Reduced energy consumption and operating costs are important operational benefits for passenger transport operators, and driving behavior has a significant impact on fuel consumption. Although many literatures or real-world systems have addressed the issues related to reducing energy consumption with electric buses, these works do not involve the records collected from an on-vehicle battery management system (BMS). Accordingly, the results of analyses of existing works lack in-depth discussions, and therefore the applicability of existing works is insignificant. Therefore, in this study, driving data were collected using a battery management system (BMS), and vehicular power consumption was classified according to energy efficiency. Then, decision trees and random forest were applied to construct energy consumption analytical models. Finally, the driving behaviors that influence energy consumption were investigated. A case study was conducted in which a Taichung passenger transport operator's electric bus driving data on urban routes were collected to construct energy consumption analytical models. The data consisted of two parts, i.e., vehicle records and route records. On the basis of these records, we considered the practicability and applicability of the analytical models by transforming the unstructured records into raw data. Passenger transport operators and drivers can leverage the obtained eco-driving indicators for different bus routes for energy savings and carbon reduction.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lian, Renzong</author><author>Peng, Jiankun</author><author>Wu, Yuankai</author><author>Tan, Huachun</author><author>Zhang, Hailong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rule-Interposing Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Energy Management Strategy for Power-Split Hybrid Electric vehicle</title><secondary-title>Energy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Energy</full-title></periodical><pages>117297</pages><volume>197</volume><keywords><keyword>Continuous action space</keyword><keyword>Deep deterministic policy gradient</keyword><keyword>Energy management strategy</keyword><keyword>Expert knowledge</keyword><keyword>Hybrid electric vehicle</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><urls/><abstract>The optimization and training processes of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based energy management strategy (EMS) can be very slow and resource-intensive.

By incorporating this prior knowledge, the proposed framework not only accelerates the learning process, but also gets a better fuel economy, thus making the energy management system relatively stable. The experimental results show that the proposed EMS outperforms the one without prior knowledge and the other state-of-art deep reinforcement learning approaches.

However, the current forecast methods are mostly based on traffic conditions to predict the speed, while ignoring the impact of the driver-vehicle-road system on the actual speed profile. In this paper, the correlation of velocity and its effect factors under various driving conditions were firstly analyzed based on driver-vehicle-road-traffic data records for a more accurate prediction model. With the modeling time and prediction time considered separately, the effectiveness and accuracy of several typical artificial-intelligence speed prediction algorithms were analyzed. The results show that the combination of niche immunegenetic algorithm-support vector machine (NIGA-SVM) prediction algorithm on the city roads with genetic algorithm-support vector machine (GA-SVM) prediction algorithm on the suburb roads and on the freeway can sharply improve the accuracy and timeliness of vehicle speed forecasting. Afterwards, the optimized GA-SVM vehicle speed prediction model was established in accordance with the optimized GA-SVM prediction algorithm at different times. And the test results verified its validity and rationality of the prediction algorithm.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Weihan</author><author>Cui, Han</author><author>Nemeth, Thomas</author><author>Jansen, Jonathan</author><author>Ünlübayir, Cem</author><author>Wei, Zhongbao</author><author>Zhang, Lei</author><author>Wang, Zhenpo</author><author>Ruan, Jiageng</author><author>Dai, Haifeng</author><author>Wei, Xuezhe</author><author>Sauer, Dirk Uwe</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Deep reinforcement learning-based energy management of hybrid battery systems in electric vehicles</title><secondary-title>Journal of Energy Storage</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Energy Storage</full-title></periodical><pages>102355</pages><volume>36</volume><keywords><keyword>Deep Q-learning</keyword><keyword>Electric vehicle</keyword><keyword>Energy management</keyword><keyword>Hybrid battery system</keyword><keyword>Lithium-ion battery</keyword><keyword>Reinforcement learning</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><urls/><abstract>In this paper, we propose an energy management strategy based on deep reinforcement learning for a hybrid battery system in electric vehicles consisting of a high-energy and a high-power battery pack.

The results show that considering all the influencing variables can significantly enhance the prediction performance, but comparatively speaking, the route characteristics contribute the most among the three categories and involving more variables demonstrates greater advantages within the trip length under 20 km. It is also found that the trip length, the number of bus stops and the number of the traffic lights passed rank the top three most influencing factors, while the wet-dry condition is the least one. In addition, the variations under five operation scenarios show similar trend. The trip length and average travel speed are inversely proportional to the specific electricity consumption, while the number of bus stops visited, traffic lights passed, and ambient temperature exhibit a gentle proportional relationship. Moreover, it is suggested to plan the new bus line over 10 km in terms of reducing electricity consumption per kilometre.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Jie</author><author>Wu, Xiaodong</author><author>Hu, Sunan</author><author>Fan, Jiawei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A deep reinforcement learning based energy management strategy for hybrid electric vehicles in connected traffic environment</title><secondary-title>IFAC-PapersOnLine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IFAC-PapersOnLine</full-title></periodical><pages>150-156</pages><volume>54</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Car following</keyword><keyword>Connected traffic environment</keyword><keyword>Energy management</keyword><keyword>Hybrid electric vehicles</keyword><keyword>Reinforcement learning control</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><urls/><abstract>This paper proposed a deep reinforcement learning based energy management strategy in the connected traffic environment. At the upper layer, a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is used to systematically integrate ego vehicle reference speed planning into the energy management strategy in the car following scenarios. At the bottom layer, a driver model and an adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy are implemented to conduct the optimal power split control based on the planned reference speed. As distance headway, fuel consumption, and terrain information are taken into consideration by the deep reinforcement learning controller, the proposed strategy can not only maintain a safe distance headway but also improve the energy efficiency of the entire driving cycle. Finally, the fuel consumption score of the proposed strategy is reduced by 3.5% compared with a car following strategy based on a proportional-integral controller. The simulation results show that the proposed strategy can learn a reasonable car following policy through the training process. In addition, the simulation duration for each reference speed planning step is only about 4.1 ms, which proves the proposed strategy can be applied online.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lemieux, Joe</author><author>Ma, Yuan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vehicle Speed Prediction Using Deep Learning</title><secondary-title>2015 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference, VPPC 2015 - Proceedings</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>2015 IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference, VPPC 2015 - Proceedings</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Deep Learning</keyword><keyword>Neural Networks</keyword><keyword>Stacked Auto Encoders</keyword><keyword>Traffic Prediction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><isbn>9781467376372</isbn><urls/><abstract>Global optimization of the energy consumption of dual power source vehicles such as hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and plug in fuel cell electric vehicles requires knowledge of the complete route characteristics at the beginning of the trip. One of the main characteristics is the vehicle speed profile across the route. The profile will translate directly into energy requirements for a given vehicle. However, the vehicle speed that a given driver chooses will vary from driver to driver and from time to time, and may be slower, equal to, or faster than the average traffic flow. If the specific driver speed profile can be predicted, the energy usage can be optimized across the route chosen. The purpose of this paper is to research the application of Deep Learning techniques to this problem to identify at the beginning of a drive cycle the driver specific vehicle speed profile for an individual driver repeated drive cycle, which can be used in an optimization algorithm to minimize the amount of fossil fuel energy used during the trip.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, Woong</author><author>Jeoung, Haeseong</author><author>Park, Dohyun</author><author>Kim, Tacksu</author><author>Lee, Heeyun</author><author>Kim, Namwook</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Real-Time Intelligent Energy Management Strategy for Hybrid Electric Vehicles Using Reinforcement Learning</title><secondary-title>IEEE Access</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Access</full-title></periodical><pages>72759-72768</pages><volume>9</volume><keywords><keyword>Energy management strategy</keyword><keyword>adaptive ECMS</keyword><keyword>deep Q-learning</keyword><keyword>hybrid electric vehicles</keyword><keyword>machine learning</keyword><keyword>optimal control</keyword><keyword>reinforcement learning</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><urls/><abstract>Equivalent Consumption Management Strategy (ECMS), a representative energy management strategy for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) derived from Pontryagin's minimum principle, is known to produce a near-optimal solution if the costate or equivalent factor of electric use is appropriately determined according to the driving conditions. One problem when applying the control concept to real-world scenarios is that it is difficult to precisely evaluate the performance of the control parameter before driving is complete, so the costate cannot be determined properly. To address this issue, this study proposes a practical method for estimating an appropriate costate based on Deep Q-Networks (DQNs), which is a reinforcement learning algorithm that uses a Deep Neural Network to evaluate the performances and determine the best control parameter or costate. The control concept benefits vehicle energy management by selecting the control parameter most related to stochastic conditions or future driving information based on artificial intelligence (AI), while optimal control is deterministically conducted by ECMS if the control parameter is given. Simply, only the implicit part of the optimal controller is solved via artificial intelligence.

In fact, the fundamental control approach of reinforcement learning shares many control frameworks with the control approach by using deterministic dynamic programming or stochastic dynamic programming. In this study, we compare the reinforcement learning based strategy by using these dynamic programming-based control approaches. For optimal control of hybrid electric vehicle, each control method was compared in terms of fuel efficiency by performing simulation by using various driving cycles. Based on our simulations, we showed the reinforcement learning-based strategy can obtain global optimality in the optimal control problem with an infinite horizon, which can also be obtained by stochastic dynamic programming. We also showed that the reinforcement learning-based strategy can present a solution close to the optimal one using deterministic dynamic programming, while a reinforcement learning-based strategy is more appropriate for a time variant controller with boundary value constraints. In addition, we verified the convergence characteristics of the control strategy based on reinforcement learning, when transfer learning was performed through value initialization using stochastic dynamic programming.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, Heeyun</author><author>Kim, Kyunghyun</author><author>Kim, Namwook</author><author>Cha, Suk Won</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Energy efficient speed planning of electric vehicles for car-following scenario using model-based reinforcement learning</title><secondary-title>Applied Energy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Applied Energy</full-title></periodical><pages>118460</pages><volume>313</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2022</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><urls/></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, Heeyun</author><author>Kang, Changbeom</author><author>Park, Yeong Il</author><author>Kim, Namwook</author><author>Cha, Suk Won</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Online Data-Driven Energy Management of a Hybrid Electric Vehicle Using Model-Based Q-Learning</title><secondary-title>IEEE Access</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Access</full-title></periodical><pages>84444-84454</pages><volume>8</volume><keywords><keyword>Hybrid electric vehicle</keyword><keyword>Q-learning</keyword><keyword>optimal control</keyword><keyword>power management</keyword><keyword>reinforcement learning</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><urls/><abstract>The energy management strategy of a hybrid electric vehicle directly determines the fuel economy of the vehicle. As a supervisory control strategy to divide the required power into its multiple power sources, engines and batteries, many studies have been conducting using rule-based and optimization-based approaches for energy management strategy so far. Recently, studies using various machine learning techniques have been conducted. In this paper, a novel control framework implementing Model-based Q-learning is developed for the optimal control problem of hybrid electric vehicles. As an online energy management strategy, a new approach could learn the characteristics of a current given driving environment and adaptively change the control policy through learning. Especially, for the proposed algorithm, the internal powertrain environment and external driving environment are separated so they can be learned via the reinforcement learning framework, which results in a simpler and more intuitive control strategy that can be explained using the vehicle state approximation model. The proposed algorithm is tested and verified through simulations, and the simulation results present near optimal solution. The simulation results are compared with conventional rule-based strategies and optimal control solutions acquired from Dynamic Programming.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, Heeyun</author><author>Cha, Suk Won</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reinforcement Learning Based on Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy for Optimal Control of Hybrid Electric Vehicles</title><secondary-title>IEEE Access</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Access</full-title></periodical><pages>860-871</pages><volume>9</volume><keywords><keyword>Equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS</keyword><keyword>hybrid Electric vehicle</keyword><keyword>model-based reinforcement learning</keyword><keyword>optimal control</keyword><keyword>power management</keyword><keyword>reinforcement learning</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><urls/><abstract>Hybrid electric vehicles, operated by engines and motors, require an energy management strategy to achieve competitive fuel economy performance. The equivalent consumption minimization strategy is a well-known algorithm that can be employed for the energy management of hybrid electric vehicles, based on the concept of the equivalent cost of fossil fuels and electric battery energy. However, in the equivalent consumption minimization strategy approach, a parameter called the equivalent factor should be determined to obtain the optimal control policy. In this study, reinforcement learning based approaches are proposed to determine the equivalent factor. First, we show that the equivalent factor can be indirectly extracted from the reinforcement learning results, using the control action from reinforcement learning for the specific driving cycle. In addition, a novel approach that combines reinforcement learning and the equivalent consumption minimization strategy is proposed, where the equivalent factor is determined based on the interaction between the reinforcement learning agent and driving environment, while the control input is decided by the equivalent consumption minimization strategy based on the determined equivalent factor. A model-based reinforcement learning method is used, and the proposed method is validated for vehicle simulation using a parallel hybrid electric vehicle. The simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve a near-optimal solution, which is close to the global solution obtained with the dynamic programming approach (96.7% compared to dynamic programming result in average), and improved performance of 4.3% in average compared with the existing adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, Heeyun</author><author>Cha, Suk Won</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Energy Management Strategy of Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles Using Model-Based Reinforcement Learning with Data-Driven Model Update</title><secondary-title>IEEE Access</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Access</full-title></periodical><pages>59244-59254</pages><volume>9</volume><keywords><keyword>Fuel cell electric vehicles</keyword><keyword>model-based reinforcement learning</keyword><keyword>optimal control</keyword><keyword>power management</keyword><keyword>reinforcement learning</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><urls/><abstract>Fuel cell electric vehicles use fuel cells as their main power source; the vehicle is driven by an electric motor, and have an electric battery as a secondary power source that stores regenerative braking energy and assists driving. To reduce the hydrogen fuel consumption by using these fuel cells and electric batteries efficiently, an energy management strategy is needed for the proper distribution of power among them. In this study, model-based reinforcement learning was utilized for energy management. For the optimal control of a fuel-cell electric vehicle, reinforcement learning is conducted using an internal vehicle powertrain model in the learning algorithm; initially, the model is completely unknown, but the model is learned with data from experiences as the learning process progresses. Then, reinforcement learning is conducted for the environment of the driving cycle profile to optimize the control policy. In this study, vehicle simulation was conducted using standard driving cycles, and the results showed that the learning process converged steadily and that the powertrain model was well learned. The simulated fuel consumption values show that the proposed algorithm reduces fuel consumption compared to the rule-based strategy by an average of 5.7%.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kwon, Hyukjoon</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Control Map Generation Strategy for Hybrid Electric Vehicles Based on Machine Learning with Energy Optimization</title><secondary-title>IEEE Access</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Access</full-title></periodical><pages>15163-15174</pages><volume>10</volume><keywords><keyword>Classification</keyword><keyword>Dynamic programming</keyword><keyword>Fuel consumption optimization</keyword><keyword>Hybrid vehicle</keyword><keyword>Machine learning</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><urls/><abstract>In this study, a control map generation strategy for hybrid electric vehicles based on machine learning (ML) with optimization data was studied using a multimode hybrid electric vehicle. The optimization data from dynamic programming were used to produce the control maps by employing different ML methods, including Gaussian naïve Bayes, linear discriminant analysis, decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, and support vector machine. Since control map domains separated into several domains can exhibit unrealistic control behavior during engine on-off and hybrid mode shift processes, control maps separated into the same number of domains were used for the simulation study among the different ML methods. The demand torque and power maps by ML training were used for simulations of representative driving test cycles from the Environmental Protection Agency. The results with ML methods indicate that operating domains in the torque and power maps were separated for different driving modes, while they were not clearly separated in the results of DP optimization. Further, the results with the control maps for demand power exhibited slightly improved fuel efficiency compared to the maps for demand torque. This study is meaningful because a control map generation strategy based on ML was not only studied in order to observe the possibility of utilizing DP optimization results for real vehicles, but different types of ML methods were also analyzed and discussed to find appropriate methods for vehicle control map generation in terms of demand torque and power operating points.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kretzschmar, Johannes</author><author>Gebhardt, Kai</author><author>Theiß, Christoph</author><author>Schau, Volkmar</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Range Prediction Models for E-Vehicles in Urban Freight Logistics Based on Machine Learning</title><secondary-title>Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)</full-title></periodical><pages>175-184</pages><volume>9714 LNCS</volume><keywords><keyword>Clustering</keyword><keyword>Electric mobility</keyword><keyword>Range prediction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><publisher>Springer Verlag</publisher><urls/><abstract>In this paper, we want to present an ICT architecture with a range prediction component, which sets up on machine learning algorithms based on consumption data.

Then, to achieve the minimum of electricity consumption and the maximum of the battery lifetime, the DQL-based EMS is designed to properly split the power demand into two parts: one is supplied by the battery and the other by supercapacitor. In addition, a hyperparameter tuning method, Bayesian optimization (BO), is introduced to optimize the hyperparameter configuration for the DQL-based EMS. Simulations are conducted to validate the improvements brought by BO and the convergence of DQL algorithm equipped with tuned hyperparameters.

However, when EVs need to be charged, the drivers still feel uncomfortable if inaccurate range prediction is provided because the inaccuracy makes it difficult to decide when and where to charge EV. In this paper, to mitigate the EV range anxiety, a new machine learning (ML) method to enhance range prediction accuracy is proposed in a practical way. For continuously obtaining the recent traffic conditions ahead, input features indicating the near-future vehicle dynamics are connected to a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, which can consecutively utilize a relation of neighboring data, and then the output features of the LSTM network with another input features consisting of energy-related vehicle system states become another input layer for deep learning network (DNN). The proposed LSTM-DNN mixture model is trained by exploiting the driving data of about 160, 000 km and the following test performance shows that the model retains the range prediction accuracy of 2 ∼ 3 km in a time window of 40 min. The test results indicate that the LSTM-DNN range prediction model is able to make a far-sighted range prediction while considering varying map and traffic information to a destination.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kang, Liuwang</author><author>Sarker, Ankur</author><author>Shen, Haiying</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Velocity Optimization of Pure Electric Vehicles with Traffic Dynamics and Driving Safety Considerations</title><secondary-title>ACM Transactions on Internet of Things</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ACM Transactions on Internet of Things</full-title></periodical><pages>1-24</pages><volume>2</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Additional Key Words and Phrases: Pure electric ve</keyword><keyword>Ankur Sarker</keyword><keyword>CCS Concepts: • Information systems → Information</keyword><keyword>and Haiying Shen 2021 Velocity Optimization of Pur</keyword><keyword>collision avoidance</keyword><keyword>eco-driving</keyword><keyword>energy consumption ACM Reference format: Liuwang K</keyword><keyword>queue length model</keyword><keyword>velocity optimization</keyword><keyword>• Computer systems organization → Embedded and cyb</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)</publisher><urls/><abstract>As Electric Vehicles (EVs) become increasingly popular, their battery-related problems (e.g., short driving range and heavy battery weight) must be resolved as soon as possible. Velocity optimization of EVs to minimize energy consumption in driving is an effective alternative to handle these problems. However, previous velocity optimization methods assume that vehicles will pass through traffic lights immediately at green traffic signals. Actually, a vehicle may still experience a delay to pass a green traffic light due to a vehicle waiting queue in front of the traffic light. Also, as velocity optimization is for individual vehicles, previous methods cannot avoid rear-end collisions. That is, a vehicle following its optimal velocity profile may experience rear-end collisions with its frontal vehicle on the road. In this article, for the first time, we propose a velocity optimization system that enables EVs to immediately pass green traffic lights without delay and to avoid rear-end collisions to ensure driving safety when EVs follow optimal velocity profiles on the road. We collected real driving data on road sections of US-25 highway (with two driving lanes in each direction and relatively low traffic volume) to conduct extensive trace-driven simulation studies. Results show that our velocity optimization system reduces energy consumption by up to 17.5% compared with real driving patterns without increasing trip time. Also, it helps EVs to avoid possible collisions compared with existing collision avoidance methods.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jing, Junbo</author><author>Filev, Dimitar</author><author>Kurt, Arda</author><author>Ozatay, Engin</author><author>Michelini, John</author><author>Ozguner, Umit</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vehicle Speed Prediction Using a Cooperative Method of Fuzzy Markov Model and Auto-Regressive Model</title><secondary-title>IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium, Proceedings</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium, Proceedings</full-title></periodical><pages>881-886</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><urls/><abstract>Vehicle speed prediction can benefit a wide range of vehicle control designs, especially for fuel economy applications.

Accurate on-road vehicle speed prediction is challenging, because an individual vehicle speed is affected by many factors, e.g., the traffic condition, vehicle type, and driver's behavior, in either deterministic or stochastic way. This paper proposes a novel data-driven vehicle speed prediction method in the context of vehicular networks, in which the real-time traffic information is accessible and utilized for vehicle speed prediction. It first predicts the average traffic speeds of road segments by using neural network models based on historical traffic data. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are then utilized to present the statistical relationship between individual vehicle speeds and the traffic speed. Prediction for individual vehicle speeds is realized by applying the forward-backward algorithm on HMMs. To evaluate the prediction performance, simulations are set up in the SUMO microscopic traffic simulator with the application of a real Luxembourg motorway network and traffic count data. The vehicle speed prediction result shows that our proposed method outperforms other ones in terms of prediction accuracy.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hua, Yining</author><author>Sevegnani, Michele</author><author>Yi, Dewei</author><author>Birnie, Andrew</author><author>Mcaslan, Steve</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fine-grained RNN with Transfer Learning for Energy Consumption Estimation on EVs</title><secondary-title>IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Adaptation models</keyword><keyword>Data models</keyword><keyword>Energy consumption</keyword><keyword>Estimation</keyword><keyword>Recurrent neural networks</keyword><keyword>Trajectory</keyword><keyword>Transfer learning</keyword><keyword>electric vehicle</keyword><keyword>energy consumption estimation</keyword><keyword>recurrent neural network</keyword><keyword>trajectory segmentation</keyword><keyword>transfer learning</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>IEEE Computer Society</publisher><urls/><abstract>Electric vehicles (EVs) are increasingly becoming an environmentally-friendly option in current transportation systems thanks to reduced fossil fuel consumption and carbon emission. However, the more widespread adoption of EVs has been hampered by two factors: the lack of charging infrastructure and the limited cruising range. Energy consumption estimation is crucial to address these challenges as it provides the foundations to enhance charging-station deployment, improve eco-driving behaviour, and extend the EV cruising range. We propose an EV energy consumption estimation method capable of achieving accurate estimation despite insufficient EV data and ragged driving trajectories. It consists of three distinct features: knowledge transfer from Internal Combustion Engine/Hybrid Electric Vehicles (ICE/HEV) to EVs, segmentation-aided trajectory granularity, time-series estimation based on bidirectional recurrent neural network.

However, the issues of the current RL setting ranging from inappropriate battery state of charge (SOC) constraint to ineffective and risky exploration make it inapplicable to many industrial energy management strategy (EMS) tasks. To address this, an adaptive hierarchical EMS combining heuristic equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) knowledge and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) which is a state-of-the-art data-driven RL algorithm is proposed in this work. For comparison purposes, the proposed strategy is contrasted with dynamic programming (DP), PID-based adaptive ECMS, rule-based and standard RL-based counterparts and the results show that the fuel consumption after SOC-correction for the proposed strategy is very close to that of the DP-based control and lower than that of the other three benchmark strategies. Considering the proposed strategy can make better use of the RL techniques while realizing an effective, efficient and safe exploration in a data-driven manner, it may become a strong foothold for future RL-based EMS to build on, especially when the controller has to be trained directly and from scratch in real-world environment.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hou, Zhuoran</author><author>Guo, Jianhua</author><author>Xing, Jiaming</author><author>Guo, Chong</author><author>Zhang, Yuanjian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Machine learning and whale optimization algorithm based design of energy management strategy for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle</title><secondary-title>IET Intelligent Transport Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IET Intelligent Transport Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>1076-1091</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>The Institution of Engineering and Technology</publisher><urls/><abstract>In this paper, a novel energy management strategy with the improved adaptability to various conditions for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) is proposed.

The aim of re-training is to customize the control strategy to a user-specific driving behavior without human intervention. The framework is designed to update the control strategy at the end of a driving task. A combination of dynamic programming and supervised machine learning is used to train the control strategy. The trained control strategy denoted as SML is compared to an online-implementable strategy based on the combination of the optimal operation line and Pontryagin’s minimum principle denoted as OOL-PMP, on the basis of fuel consumption. SML consistently performed better than OOL-PMP, evaluated over five standard drive cycles. The EUDC performance was almost identical while on FTP75 the OOL-PMP consumed 14.7% more fuel than SML. Moreover, the deviation from the global benchmark obtained from dynamic programming was between 1.8% and 5.4% for SML and between 5.8% and 16.8% for OOL-PMP. Furthermore, a test-case was conducted to emulate a real-world driving scenario wherein a trained controller is exposed to a new drive cycle.

Thus, SOC estimation of lithium-ion batteries has been widely investigated because of their fast charging, long-life cycle, and high energy density characteristics. However, precise SOC assessment of lithium-ion batteries remains challenging because of their varying characteristics under different working environments. Machine learning techniques have been widely used to design an advanced SOC estimation method without the information of battery chemical reactions, battery models, internal properties, and additional filters. Here, the capacity of optimized machine learning techniques are presented toward enhanced SOC estimation in terms of learning capability, accuracy, generalization performance, and convergence speed. We validate the proposed method through lithium-ion battery experiments, EV drive cycles, temperature, noise, and aging effects. We show that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy, adaptability, and robustness under diverse operating conditions.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Han, Xuefeng</author><author>He, Hongwen</author><author>Wu, Jingda</author><author>Peng, Jiankun</author><author>Li, Yuecheng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Energy Management Based on Reinforcement Learning with Double Deep Q-Learning for a Hybrid Electric Tracked Vehicle</title><secondary-title>Applied Energy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Applied Energy</full-title></periodical><pages>113708</pages><volume>254</volume><keywords><keyword>Double deep Q-learning</keyword><keyword>Energy management</keyword><keyword>Hybrid vehicle</keyword><keyword>Reinforcement learning</keyword><keyword>Tracked-vehicle</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><urls/><abstract>An energy management strategy, based on double deep Q-learning algorithm, is proposed for a dual-motor driven hybrid electric tracked-vehicle.

This work focuses on analyzing the impact of different factors affecting the driving range of EVs and developing a deep learning-based optimized system for range prediction using neural networks. An electric vehicle model is developed in MATLAB Simulink to analyze the impact of various factors on the driving range and validation of the range prediction model. A comparative study on different neural network models is done using the Keras framework to select the best suited regression model to predict the driving range based on prediction error. The analysis reveals the impact of various factors like driver behaviour, exploitation environment, battery parameters, and auxiliary loads on the driving range. For the test data, the bidirectional long short-term memory shows the minimum error compared to other sequential models with a mean square error of 0.029 km in the prediction of driving range. The work can be further extended by integrating to driver assistance systems for best route selection, charge scheduling, trip planning etc.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gao, Jinfeng</author><author>Chang, Ting Cheng</author><author>Yao, Ruxian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An Adaptive Intelligent System to Minimize Energy Use for a Parallel Hybrid Electric Vehicle</title><secondary-title>Microsystem Technologies</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Microsystem Technologies</full-title></periodical><pages>1483-1496</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Electronics and Microelectronics</keyword><keyword>Instrumentation</keyword><keyword>Mechanical Engineering</keyword><keyword>Nanotechnology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH</publisher><urls/><abstract>This paper elaborates on the synthesis of a neuro-fuzzy controller and also its application to hybrid vehicle powertrain control system.

Thus it has been the subject of numerous research studies spanning decades. One of the most challenging aspects of an Optimal EMS is that FE gains are typically directly related to high fidelity predictions of future vehicle operation. In this research, a comprehensive dataset is exploited which includes internal data (CAN bus) and external data (radar information and V2V) gathered over numerous instances of two highway drive cycles and one urban/highway mixed drive cycle. This dataset is used to derive a prediction model for vehicle velocity for the next 10 seconds, which is a range which has a significant FE improvement potential. This achieved 10 second vehicle velocity prediction is then compared to perfect full drive cycle prediction, perfect 10 second prediction. These various velocity predictions are used as an input into an Optimal EMS derivation algorithm to derive an engine torque and engine speed control strategy that improves FE compared to current vehicle operation. Dynamic programming is used as the Optimal EMS because it provides a globally optimal control which is preferable for this investigatory study. The vehicle model used is real world validated and represents a 2017 Toyota Prius Prime operating in charge sustaining mode. The results show that actual vehicle velocity prediction from the prediction model achieves 85% of the FE improvement from an Optimal EMS derived using perfect 10 second prediction.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fotouhi, Abbas</author><author>Montazeri, M</author><author>Jannatipour, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vehicle’s Velocity Time Series Prediction Using Neural Network</title><secondary-title>International journal of automotive engineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International journal of automotive engineering</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><urls/></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Foiadelli, Federica</author><author>Longo, Michela</author><author>Miraftabzadeh, Seyedmahdi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Energy Consumption Prediction of Electric Vehicles Based on Big Data Approach</title><secondary-title>Proceedings - 2018 IEEE International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering and 2018 IEEE Industrial and Commercial Power Systems Europe, EEEIC/I and CPS Europe 2018</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings - 2018 IEEE International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering and 2018 IEEE Industrial and Commercial Power Systems Europe, EEEIC/I and CPS Europe 2018</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Big Data</keyword><keyword>Electric Vehicles</keyword><keyword>Energy</keyword><keyword>Machine Learning</keyword><keyword>Range Estimation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><urls/><abstract>An accurate prediction of the electric vehicles (EVs) energy consumption is the crucial requirement to deliver the promise of the green energy solution for relieving the concerns from fossil energy depletion and vehicle emissions. To solve the problem, the most substantial facing challenges are laying down on heterogeneous data insight, modelling the non-linear problem, and the lack of supporting technologies to provide the primary data to model the problem. In this paper, the latent pattern of the heterogeneous data is extracted and presented as a new set of metadata.

Analysing and predicting vehicle energy consumption becomes a major concern. Vehicle energy consumption depends not only on speed but also on a number of external factors such as road topology, traffic, driving style, etc. Obtaining the cost for each link (i.e., link energy consumption) in road networks plays a key role in energy-optimal route planning process. This paper presents a novel framework that identifies vehicle/driving environment-dependent factors to predict energy consumption over a road network based on historical consumption data for different vehicle types. We design a deep-learning-based structure, called DeepFEC, to forecast accurate energy consumption in each and every road in a city based on real traffic conditions. A residual neural network and recurrent neural network are employed to model the spatial and temporal closeness, respectively. Static vehicle data reflecting vehicle type, vehicle weight, engine configuration and displacement are also learned. The outputs of these neural networks are dynamically aggregated to improve the spatially correlated time series data forecasting. Extensive experiments conducted on a diverse fleet consisting of 264 gasoline vehicles, 92 Hybrid Electric Vehicles, and 27 Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles/Electric Vehicles drove in Michigan road network, show that our proposed deep learning algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art prediction algorithms.

Depending upon SOC status at the trip end of PEVs, the operator decides the charging and discharging of vehicles. Therefore, accurate prediction is the need of the demand to know the exact status of PEVs SOC. The total trip distance of PEVs and energy consumption pattern of different sizes of PEVs are also included so that calculation of SOC can be made to accurate. The prediction analysis is carried out by using machine learning approaches like gradient boosting method (GBM) and random forest method (RFM). Tree based ensemble method improves the worst performance by adding additional trees. The additional trees in GBM further improve the prediction accuracy of PEVs SOC.

Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute</research-notes><urls/><abstract>Limited driving range remains one of the barriers for widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). To address the problem of range anxiety, this paper presents an energy consumption prediction method for EVs, designed for energy-efficient routing. This data-driven methodology combines real-world measured driving data with geographical and weather data to predict the consumption over any given road in a road network. The driving data are linked to the road network using geographic information system software that allows to separate trips into segments with similar road characteristics. The energy consumption over road segments is estimated using a multiple linear regression (MLR) model that links the energy consumption with microscopic driving parameters (such as speed and acceleration) and external parameters (such as temperature). A neural network (NN) is used to predict the unknown microscopic driving parameters over a segment prior to departure, given the road segment characteristics and weather conditions. The complete proposed model predicts the energy consumption with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 12–14% of the average trip consumption, of which 7–9% is caused by the energy consumption estimation of the MLR model. This method allows for prediction of energy consumption over any route in the road network prior to departure, and enables cost-optimization algorithms to calculate energy efficient routes. The data-driven approach has the advantage that the model can easily be updated over time with changing conditions.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Croce, Vincenzo</author><author>Raveduto, Giuseppe</author><author>Verber, Matteo</author><author>Ziu, Denisa</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Combining Machine Learning Analysis and Incentive-based Genetic Algorithms to Optimise Energy District Renewable Self-Consumption in Demand-Response Programs</title><secondary-title>Electronics (Switzerland)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Electronics (Switzerland)</full-title></periodical><pages>1-19</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Demand response</keyword><keyword>Electric vehicles</keyword><keyword>FIWARE</keyword><keyword>Forecast</keyword><keyword>Load shifting</keyword><keyword>Machine learning</keyword><keyword>Multi-objective optimization</keyword><keyword>Peak shaving</keyword><keyword>RES</keyword><keyword>Second-life batteries</keyword><keyword>Storage system</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year></dates><publisher>MDPI AG</publisher><urls/><abstract>The recent rise of renewable energy sources connected to the distribution networks and the high peak consumptions requested by electric vehicle-charging bring new challenges for network operators. To operate smart electricity grids, cooperation between grid-owned and third-party assets becomes crucial. In this paper, we propose a methodology that combines machine learning with multi-objective optimization to accurately plan the exploitation of the energy district’s flexibility with the objective of reducing peak consumption and avoiding reverse power flow. Using historical data, acquired by the smart meters deployed on the pilot district, the district’s power profile can be predicted daily and analyzed to identify potentially critical issues on the network. District’s resources, such as electric vehicles, charging stations, photovoltaic panels, buildings energy management systems, and energy storage systems, have been modeled by taking into account their operational constraints and the multi-objective optimization has been adopted to identify the usage pattern that better suits the distribution operator’s (DSO) needs. The district is subject to incentives and penalties based on its ability to respond to the DSO request. Analysis of the results shows that this methodology can lead to a substantial reduction of both the reverse power flow and peak consumption.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cheng, Zheyuan</author><author>Chow, Mo Yuen</author><author>Jung, Daebong</author><author>Jeon, Jinyong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Big Data Based Deep Learning Approach for Vehicle Speed Prediction</title><secondary-title>IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics</full-title></periodical><pages>389-394</pages><keywords><keyword>Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)</keyword><keyword>Big data</keyword><keyword>Deep learning</keyword><keyword>Vehicle speed prediction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><isbn>9781509014125</isbn><urls/><abstract>Vehicle speed prediction plays an important role in Data-Driven Intelligent Transportation System (D2ITS) and electric vehicle energy management.

A big data based deep learning vehicle speed prediction algorithm featuring big data analytics and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is presented in this paper. Big data analytics examines copious amounts of speed related data to identify the pattern and correlation between input factors and vehicle speed.

During the strategy search, several different standard driving schedules are chosen, and the transfer probability of the power demand is derived based on the Markov chain. Accordingly, the optimal control strategy is found by the Qlearning (QL) algorithm, which can decide suitable energy allocation between the gasoline engine and the battery pack. Simulation results indicate that the RL-based control strategy could not only lessen fuel consumption under different driving cycles, but also limit the maximum discharge power of battery, compared with the charging depletion/charging sustaining (CD/CS) method and the equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS).</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Zheng</author><author>Guo, Ningyuan</author><author>Shen, Jiangwei</author><author>Xiao, Renxin</author><author>Dong, Peng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Hierarchical Energy Management Strategy for Power-Split Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles Considering Velocity Prediction</title><secondary-title>IEEE Access</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE Access</full-title></periodical><pages>33261-33274</pages><volume>6</volume><keywords><keyword>Hierarchical energy management</keyword><keyword>model predictive control (MPC)</keyword><keyword>radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN)</keyword><keyword>velocity prediction</keyword><keyword>wavelet transform (WT)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year></dates><publisher>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.</publisher><urls/><abstract>In this paper, a hierarchical energy management strategy is proposed to achieve optimal energy distribution in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles by dividing the energy management algorithm into two layers.

Thus, the corresponding control performance is strongly dependent on the quality of state of charge reference generation. This paper proposes an intelligent equivalent consumption minimum strategy based on dual neural networks and a novel equivalent factor correction, which can adaptively regulate the equivalent factor to achieve the near-optimal fuel economy without the support of the state of charge reference. The Bayesian regularization neural network is constructed to predict the near-optimal equivalent factor online, while the backpropagation neural network is designed to forecast the engine on/off with the aim of improving the quality of equivalent factor prediction. The corresponding neural network training takes advantage of the global optimality of dynamic programming. Besides, the novel equivalent factor correction can guarantee that the electrical energy is gradually consumed along the trip and the terminal battery state of charge satisfies the preset constraints. A series of virtual simulations under a total of nine driving cycles demonstrates that the proposed method can deliver a competitive fuel economy comparing to the optimal solution derived from the dynamic programming, as well as regulating the battery state of charge to reach the desired terminal value at the end of the trip.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chandran, Venkatesan</author><author>Patil, Chandrashekhar K.</author><author>Karthick, Alagar</author><author>Ganeshaperumal, Dharmaraj</author><author>Rahim, Robbi</author><author>Ghosh, Aritra</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>State of charge Estimation of Lithium-ion battery for Electric Vehicles Using Machine Learning Algorithms</title><secondary-title>World Electric Vehicle Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>World Electric Vehicle Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>38</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Battery management</keyword><keyword>Electric vehicles</keyword><keyword>Lithium-ion battery</keyword><keyword>Machine learning algo-rithms</keyword><keyword>State of charge</keyword><keyword>Sustainable energy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>MDPI AG</publisher><urls/><abstract>The durability and reliability of battery management systems in electric vehicles to forecast the state of charge (SoC) is a tedious task.

In order to improve the electric energy efficiency in power battery and meet the practical requirements of energy management strategies, an intelligent SOC-consumption allocation of commercial plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in variable scenario is proposed in this paper. Generated by random combination of the selected driving cycle units, the variable scene could reflect the driving situation of commercial vehicles performing transportation tasks at some extent. The strategy is trained and generated by a reinforcement learning framework. Firstly, a power-flow analysis model is constructed. Then, a dynamic programming description that could solve the optimal power-flow is defined. Furthermore, the optimizations for different initial conditions were performed repeatedly. With the solution results, an energy-conversion model is generated to describes the conversion of fuel and electricity, and reward in reinforcement learning was defined and used to guide the agent to improve and enhance the required SOC-allocation strategy. The trained strategy performed a reasonable SOC-allocation according to the cycle unit and residual SOC; and fuel consumption under average condition is significantly lower than that of two normally used SOC-allocation strategies.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cabani, Adnane</author><author>Zhang, Peiwen</author><author>Khemmar, Redouane</author><author>Xu, Jin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Enhancement of Energy Consumption Estimation for Electric Vehicles by using Machine Learning</title><secondary-title>IAES International Journal of Artificial Intelligence (IJ-AI)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IAES International Journal of Artificial Intelligence (IJ-AI)</full-title></periodical><pages>215</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Electric vehicle</keyword><keyword>Energy consumption</keyword><keyword>Intelligent transportation systems K-NN</keyword><keyword>Machine learning</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science</publisher><urls/><abstract>Three main classes are considered of signiﬁcant inﬂuence factors when predicting the energy consumption rate of electric vehicles (EV): environment, driver behaviour, and vehicle. These classes take into account constant or variable parameters which inﬂuences the energy consumption of the EV. In this paper, we develop a new model taking into account the three classes as well as the interaction between them in order to improve the quality of EV energy consumption. The model depends on a new approach based on machine learning and especially k-NN algorithm in order to estimate the EV energy consumption. Following a lazy learning paradigm, this approach allows better estimation performance. The advantage of our proposal, in regards to mathematical approach, is taking into account the real situation of the ecosystem on the basis of historical data. In fact, the behavior of the driver (driving style, heating usage, air conditioner usage, battery state, etc.) impacts directly the EV energy consumption. The obtained results show that we can reach up to 96.5% of accuracy about the estimated of energy-consumption.

Modelling the remaining range is closely related with modelling the energy consumption of an electric vehicle. The latter remains an open problem due to unknown context data that may apply such as driving trip speed, vehicle load and topographical characteristics. In this work, a regression model is formulated in order to learn, from time/location-variant real driving data, a relationship between the future energy consumption on one side, and the following related factors, which are considered known, on the other side: i) the difference in average velocity between the future and the past ii) the difference in elevation rate between the future and the past and iii) the recent past energy consumption. Experimental results onaround 2000km of discharge trips, demonstrate the effectiveness of the method over a conventional method that is based solely on historic energy usage evidence.

This paper introduces the Dynamic Stochastic Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (DS-EVRP). A Safe Reinforcement Learning method is proposed for solving the problem. The objective is to minimize expected energy consumption in a safe way, which means also minimizing the risk of battery depletion while en route by planning charging whenever necessary. The key idea is to learn offline about the stochastic customer requests and energy consumption using Monte Carlo simulations, to be able to plan the route predictively and safely online. The method is evaluated using simulations based on energy consumption data from a realistic traffic model for the city of Luxembourg and a high-fidelity vehicle model.

This paper presents the time-dependent Electric Vehicle Routing Problem with Chance-Constraints (EVRP-CC) and partial recharging. The routing method is divided into two stages, where the first finds the best paths and the second optimizes the routes. A probabilistic Bayesian machine learning approach is proposed for predicting the expected energy consumption and variance for the road links, paths and routes. Hence it is possible to consider the uncertainty in energy demand by planning charging within a confidence interval. The energy estimation is validated with data from electric buses driving a public transport route in Gothenburg-Sweden as well as with realistic simulations for 24 hours traffic in the city of Luxembourg connected to a high fidelity vehicle model. Routing solutions are compared with a deterministic formulation of the problem similar to the ones found in the literature. The results indicate high accuracy for the energy prediction as well as energy savings and more reliability for the routes.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barimani, Nasim</author><author>Moshiri, Behzad</author><author>Teshnehlab, Mohammad</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>State Space Modeling and Short-Term Traffic Speed Prediction Using Kalman Filter Based on ANFIS</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Engineering and Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Engineering and Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>116-120</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><publisher>IACSIT Press</publisher><urls/></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bansal, Sakshi</author><author>Dey, Satadru</author><author>Khanra, Munmun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Energy storage sizing in plug-in Electric Vehicles: Driving cycle uncertainty effect analysis and machine learning based sizing framework</title><secondary-title>Journal of Energy Storage</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Energy Storage</full-title></periodical><pages>102864</pages><volume>41</volume><keywords><keyword>Driving cycle uncertainties</keyword><keyword>Electric Vehicle (EV)</keyword><keyword>Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS)</keyword><keyword>Machine learning</keyword><keyword>Optimal sizing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><urls/><abstract>Transportation electrification has been considered as one of the promising solutions towards clean environment. On-board Energy Storage System (ESS) has significant influence on the cost and reliability of Electric Vehicles (EVs). Furthermore, the choice of the ESS in terms of type and size, i.e., its capacity heavily depends on the driving patterns which, usually, vary significantly depending on factors like driver characteristics, geographical locations and traffic congestion. Hence, it is crucial to understand the effect of driving patterns/cycles on the sizing of ESS in order to avoid over/under-sizing. In this context, we investigate the effect of driving cycle uncertainties on the optimal sizing of ESS in EVs. We specifically focus on the uncertainty arising from the unpredictability of the future state of speed and acceleration and model the same as a scaling factor on velocity-magnitudes and time-windows of the velocity profile. Subsequently, (i) we derive the quantitative relationship between uncertainty and corresponding change in ESS size based on four thousand test driving cycles; (ii) we develop a framework which provides a guideline towards the choice of appropriate sizing of ESS in EVs subject to uncertainty in driving cycle; and (iii) we propose a machine-learning based framework that can enable a data-driven approach for ESS sizing with lower computational requirement. We choose a city bus application to illustrate our approach and consider three different ESS configurations: (i) Li-ion battery alone, (ii) Supercapacitor alone, and (iii) Battery–Supercapacitor hybrid ESS.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baker, David</author><author>Asher, Zachary</author><author>Bradley, Thomas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Investigation of Vehicle Speed Prediction from Neural Network Fit of Real World Driving Data for Improved Engine On/Off Control of the EcoCAR3 Hybrid Camaro</title><secondary-title>SAE Technical Papers</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SAE Technical Papers</full-title></periodical><volume>2017-March</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>SAE International</publisher><urls/><abstract>The EcoCAR3 competition challenges student teams to redesign a 2016 Chevrolet Camaro to reduce environmental impacts and increase energy efficiency while maintaining performance and safety that consumers expect from a Camaro. Energy management of the new hybrid powertrain is an integral component of the overall efficiency of the car and is a prime focus of Colorado State University's (CSU) Vehicle Innovation Team. Previous research has shown that error-less predictions about future driving characteristics can be used to more efficiently manage hybrid powertrains. In this study, a novel, real-world implementable energy management strategy is investigated for use in the EcoCAR3 Hybrid Camaro. This strategy uses a Nonlinear Autoregressive Artificial Neural Network with Exogenous inputs (NARX Artificial Neural Network) trained with real-world driving data from a selected drive cycle to predict future vehicle speeds along that drive cycle. Various prediction windows are analyzed and compared to quantify tradeoffs between prediction window size and speed prediction error for a given drive cycle. To investigate the fuel economy (FE) improvement potential of this new control strategy, a high fidelity model of a Toyota Prius, developed by Colorado State University, is used. An optimal dynamic programming (DP) engine controller is implemented in the Prius model. Several exemplar controllers are studied for the specified drive cycle: the model baseline controller, a DP derived engine controller using NARX Artificial Neural Network speed predictions, and a DP derived engine controller using a 100% accurate speed prediction. These simulations allow for investigation into the tradeoffs between different prediction window sizes. Additionally, the results provide insight into what FE benefit can be expected from speed prediction compared to baseline and idealized conditions. This potentially achievable FE benefit is used as motivation to develop a predictive controller that can be implemented in real-time on the supervisory controller of CSU's Plug-in Hybrid Electric (PHEV) Camaro.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Aljohani, Tawfiq M.</author><author>Ebrahim, Ahmed</author><author>Mohammed, Osama</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Real-Time metadata-driven routing optimization for electric vehicle energy consumption minimization using deep reinforcement learning and Markov chain model</title><secondary-title>Electric Power Systems Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Electric Power Systems Research</full-title></periodical><pages>106962</pages><volume>192</volume><keywords><keyword>Artificial intelligence (AI)</keyword><keyword>Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN)</keyword><keyword>Electric vehicles (EVs)</keyword><keyword>Energy minimization framework</keyword><keyword>Google's API platform</keyword><keyword>Markov Chain Model (MCM)</keyword><keyword>Reinforcement Learning (RL)</keyword><keyword>Routing optimization</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><urls/><abstract>A real-time, data-driven electric vehicle (EVs) routing optimization to achieve energy consumption minimization is proposed in this work. The proposed framework utilizes the concept of Double Deep Q-learning Network (DDQN) in learning the maximum travel policy of the EV as an agent. The policy model is trained to estimate the agent's optimal action per the obtained reward signals and Q-values, representing the feasible routing options. The agent's energy requirement on the road is assessed following Markov Chain Model (MCM), with Markov's unit step represented as the average energy consumption that takes into consideration the different driving patterns, agent's surrounding environment, road conditions, and applicable restrictions. The framework offers a better exploration strategy, continuous learning ability, and the adoption of individual routing preferences. A real-time simulation in the python environment that considered real-life driving data from Google's API platform is performed. Results obtained for two geographically different drives show that the proposed energy consumption minimization framework reduced the energy utilization of the EVs to reach its intended destination by 5.89% and 11.82%, compared with Google's proposed routes originally.

An energy management strategy (EMS) has recently been developed, where batteries and supercapacitors (SCs) are coordinated as a function of the driving mode which is determined manually by the driver. In the present article, we improve the EMS by developing a driving mode predictor (DMP) that determines automatically in real-time the driving mode simply from the speed history of the vehicle. The DMP is designed using supervised learning (SL), a branch of machine learning (ML). A strength of our approach is that it is applicable to predict the driving modes of any EV. To predict the driving modes during a trip made by a given EV, the DMP needs to follow the speed evolution of the EV and know its maximum reachable speed. The integration of the DMP into the EMS results in an enhanced EMS called DMP-based EMS that determines automatically in real-time the power to take from each source of energy of the EV as a function of its speed history. The results obtained from real driving cycles confirm the prediction quality of the DMP and the energy efficiency of the proposed DMP-based EMS.</abstract></record><record><database name="My Collection.enl" path="My Collection.enl">My Collection.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Abdelaty, Hatem</author><author>Al-Obaidi, Abdullah</author><author>Mohamed, Moataz</author><author>Farag, Hany E.Z.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Machine Learning Prediction Models for Battery-Electric Bus Energy Consumption in Transit</title><secondary-title>Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment</full-title></periodical><pages>102868</pages><volume>96</volume><keywords><keyword>Battery electric buses</keyword><keyword>Data-driven modelling techniques</keyword><keyword>Energy consumption</keyword><keyword>Factorial design</keyword><keyword>Operational/topological parameters</keyword><keyword>Sensitivity analysis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year></dates><publisher>Pergamon</publisher><urls/><abstract>The energy consumption (EC) of battery-electric buses (BEB) varies significantly due to the intertwined relationships of vehicular, operational, topological, and external parameters. This variation is posing several challenges to predict BEB's energy consumption. Several studies are calling for the development of data-driven models to address this challenge. This study develops and compares seven data-driven modelling techniques that cover both machine learning and statistical models. The models are based on a full-factorial experimental design (n = 907,199) of a validated Simulink energy simulation model. The models are then used to predict EC using a testing dataset (n = 169,344). The results show some minor discrepancies between the developed models. All models explained more than 90% of the energy consumption variance. Further, the results indicate that road gradient and the battery state of charge are the most influential factors on EC, while driver behaviour and drag coefficient have the lowest impact.</abstract></record></records></xml>
