abstract = {The two power sources of a fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) are proton electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and Li-ion battery (LIB). The health status of PEMFC and LIB decreases with the use of FCEV, so the energy management strategy (EMS) needs to give an optimal power distribution based on the health status of power sources throughout the lifetime. However, rule-based control strategies cannot achieve this. To prolong the service lifetime of two power sources by optimizing power distribution, this article proposes a long-term energy management strategy (LTEMS) for FCEV, which contains a reinforcement learning module and an improved thermostat controller. By designing a reward function, the reinforcement learning module outputted various LIB state of charge (SOC) boundary which changes with power source attenuation. Based on SOC boundary, the improved thermostat controller will control the fuel cell current under specific driving conditions. Simulation was carried out based on different LIB state of health (SOH) and external temperature, and the simulation results were compared with the data collected from FCEV under rule-based (RB) strategies. It can be found that the proposed LTEMS can effectively reduce fuel cell and LIB attenuation, and meet the FCEV power demand.},

abstract = {The formulation of high-efficient energy management strategy (EMS) for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) becomes the most crucial task owing to the variation of electrified powertrain topology and uncertainty of driving scenarios. In this study, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, namely TD3, is leveraged to derivate intelligent EMS for HEV. A heuristic rule-based local controller (LC) is embedded within the DRL loop to eliminate irrational torque allocation with considering the characteristics of powertrain components. In order to resolve the influence of environmental disturbance, a hybrid experience replay (HER) method is proposed based on a mixed experience buffer (MEB) consisting of offline computed optimal experience and online learned experience. The results indicate that improved TD3 based EMS obtained the best fuel optimality, fastest convergence speed and highest robustness in comparison to typical value-based and policy-based DRL EMSs under various driving cycles. LC leads to a boosting effect on the convergence speed of TD3-based EMS wherein a “warm” start of exploring is exhibited. Meanwhile, by incorporating HER coupled with MEB, the impact of environmental disturbance including load mass and road gradient, as an increase of input observations, can be negligible to the performance of TD3-based EMS.},

abstract = {The Plug-in hybrid vehicle (PHEV) has been progressively penetrated in the urban public transport system and seen a foreseeable fast growth in the future. Within this horizon, energy management is an enabling technique for the cost-efficient operation of the PHEV. In this paper, a model predictive control (MPC)-based real-time energy management strategy (EMS) combining a cloud-enabled velocity profile optimizer (VPO) and vehicle-side velocity predictor is proposed for the Plug-in hybrid bus (PHEB) under the intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Particularly, the velocity profile and the state of charge (SOC) sequences are optimized by incorporating the genetic algorithm (GA) with the dynamic programming (DP), giving rise to a novel GA-DP-based VPO. In the case that the vehicle can be hardly decoupled from the traffic flow, a multi-feature predictor based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Network is triggered to replace the cloud-enabled VPO to predict the short-term velocity. Results show that the prediction accuracy can be improved by 5.4% by employing the multi-feature training. The equivalent fuel consumption with the mode-switching EMS in the optimized UDDS cycle can be reduced by 14.9% compared with the state of the art. The proposed strategy is validated with a real-time performance by performing the hardware in the loop (HIL) experiment.},

abstract = {This paper addresses two conflicts in the energy management strategy (EMS) for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). One is the conflict between fuel economy optimization and battery state of health preservation, and the other is the conflict between global optimality and real-time capability. Inspired by the hierarchy structure of a computer, a two-layer internet-distributed EMS (ID-EMS) is developed using cloud computing and the internet of vehicles. The top layer in the cloud, which possesses powerful calculating capability, focuses on global optimality by utilizing machine learning technology and stochastic dynamic programming. The bottom layer on board, with limited computing power, employs a fuzzy controller to respond to real-time conditions while trying not to deviate too far from the global solution. Thus, a real-time global optimal EMS can be achieved. The ID-EMS is implemented on an internet-distributed vehicle-in-the-loop simulation platform whose in-loop vehicle makes it possible to test the ID-EMS in an on-road driving experiment. The ID-EMS outperforms a rule-based EMS in terms of overall cost by 6.8%, but it is surpassed by an acausal EMS with dynamic programming by 7%. These results suggest directions for the future development of EMS for PHEVs using cloud computing.},

However, most of existing control strategies and global optimization algorithms for EAD systems have extremely high requirements for computational resources, which make EAD systems not easy to popularize and apply to real vehicles. To overcome this problem, this paper designs a traffic flow prediction model based on deep learning regression machine, and establishes a dynamic effective red-light duration model based on traffic flow queuing effect. To facilitate real-time update of the optimal speed, a constrained optimization model is proposed as an approximation approach, which can obtain similar optimal results to that of the pseudo-spectral method while greatly reducing calculating time. The effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm for EAD system on passing intersections and energy saving has been validated on the real vehicle under real-world traffic environment. Compared with the uninformed driver, the proposed EAD system saves 2% time and 4.6% energy on average in case that driver is informed and 8% time and 12.1% energy in case of autonomous driving.},

Nowadays, people often drive a vehicle on fixed routes in their daily travels and accurate speed predictions of these routes are possible with random prediction and machine learning, but the prediction accuracy still needs to be improved. The prediction accuracy of traditional prediction algorithms is difficult to further improve after reaching a certain accuracy; problems, such as over fitting, occur in the process of improving prediction accuracy. The combined prediction model proposed in this paper can abandon the transitional dependence on a single prediction. By combining the two prediction algorithms, the fusion of prediction performance is achieved, the limit of the single prediction performance is crossed, and the goal of improving vehicle speed prediction performance is achieved. In this paper, an extraction method suitable for fixed route vehicle speed is designed. The application of Markov and back propagation (BP) neural network in predictions is introduced. Three new combined prediction methods, all named Markov and BP Neural Network (MBNN) combined prediction algorithm, are proposed, which make full use of the advantages of Markov and BP neural network algorithms. Finally, the comparison among the prediction methods has been carried out. The results show that the three MBNN models have improved by about 19%, 28%, and 29% compared with the Markov prediction model, which has better performance in the single prediction models. Overall, the MBNN combined prediction models can improve the prediction accuracy by 25.3% on average, which provides important support for the possible optimization of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle energy consumption.},

Most of the existing EAD applications have been developed and tested in traffic-free scenarios or in a fully connected environment, where the presence and behavior of all surrounding vehicles are detectable. In this paper, we describe a prediction-based EAD strategy that can be applied toward more realistic scenarios, where the surrounding vehicles can be either a connected or non-connected. Unlike highway scenarios, predicting speed trajectories along signalized corridors is much more challenging due to disturbances from signals, traffic queues, and pedestrians. Based on vehicle activity data available via inter-vehicle communication or onboard sensing (e.g., by radar), we evaluate three state-of-the-art nonlinear regression models to perform short-term speed forecasting of the preceding vehicle. It turns out radial basis function neural network outperformed both Gaussian process and multi-layer perceptron network in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Using signal phase and timing information and the predicted state of the preceding vehicle, our prediction-based EAD algorithm achieved better fuel economy and emissions reduction in urban traffic and queues at intersections.

abstract = {In this work, an advanced range estimation method based on experimental test data including environmental factors and dynamic vehicle parameters with driver and road type predictions is proposed for electric vehicles. The focus point of the given study is to predict remaining range in general, at first start-up, without knowing future driving profile, in terms of giving an idea of how much distance can be travelled with the remaining amount of energy. Road type and driver profile are estimated by utilizing decision tree method and periodogram of jerk trace, respectively. Based on the preliminary results, utilized decision tree algorithm classifies the road type with an accuracy over 98%. Vehicle range is estimated online by using machine learning algorithm based on experimental train data sets where chassis dynamometer tests were conducted by performing specific driving cycle in various conditions. For a real life verification, the vehicle is driven for a 50.4 km distance in a road having mostly urban driving characteristics. The results of real life measurements show that the proposed method predicts range with a low margin of error and estimates final remaining capacity 11.3% better than rated one.},

abstract = {Vehicle energy consumption and powertrain operations for future vehicle powertrain technologies are predicted through full-vehicle simulations using Autonomie, a simulation tool developed at Argonne National Laboratory. Over 1 million vehicles, with different powertrain types (conventional and numerous electrified powertrains) and component technologies (advanced engines, batteries, electrical machines, light weighting) are simulated for outputs including vehicle fuel economy and cost. Despite the ability of Autonomie to predict fuel economy given various combination of vehicle inputs, the full-vehicle simulation is very time-consuming. It takes approximately 84 h to simulate for 33,060 vehicles even using distributed computing on a cluster of 128 worker nodes. Moreover, Autonomie is unable to populate a continuous output space through simulation since it only yields outputs with discrete values instead of an input-output relation. This paper proposes a novel large-scale learning and prediction process (LSLPP) via machine learning approaches to answer the need for a continuous space of vehicle fuel economy and a more efficient simulation process. By learning in a supervised fashion to discover structures in data, the machine learning approaches seek to train a model that can explain the data with which we can perform prediction over unseen data. As such, we are able to accomplish analytic continuation on the current discrete space of simulation results. In addition, we present a random-sampling-based numerosity reduction algorithm incorporated in LSLPP that reduces simulation runs and improves efficiency of data procurement. We analytically derive a theoretical bound in order to guarantee the effectiveness of our algorithm. We also compare random sampling to stratified sampling and suggest sampling strategies. A user-friendly tool is developed to support the process. Our experimental results confirm that the proposed LSLPP is able to greatly accelerate prediction and analysis of vehicle fuel economy. The output of this study is used by the US government to evaluate the impact of its R&D funding on energy security and CO 2 emission as well as for the setting of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.},

abstract = {Accurate prediction of traffic information (i.e., traffic flow, travel time, traffic speed, etc.) is a key component of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). Traffic speed is an important indicator to evaluate traffic efficiency. Up to date, although a few studies have considered the periodic feature in traffic prediction, very few studies comprehensively evaluate the impact of periodic component on statistical and machine learning prediction models. This paper selects several representative statistical models and machine learning models to analyze the influence of periodic component on short-term speed prediction under different scenarios: (1) multi-horizon ahead prediction (5, 15, 30, 60 minutes ahead predictions), (2) with and without periodic component, (3) two data aggregation levels (5-minute and 15-minute), (4) peak hours and off-peak hours. Specifically, three statistical models (i.e., space time (ST) model, vector autoregressive (VAR) model, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model) and three machine learning approaches (i.e., support vector machines (SVM) model, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model, recurrent neural network (RNN) model) are developed and examined. Furthermore, the periodic features of the speed data are considered via a hybrid prediction method, which assumes that the data consist of two components: a periodic component and a residual component. The periodic component is described by a trigonometric regression function, and the residual component is modeled by the statistical models or the machine learning approaches. The important conclusions can be summarized as follows: (1) the multi-step ahead prediction accuracy improves when considering the periodic component of speed data for both three statistical models and three machine learning models, especially in the peak hours; (2) considering the impact of periodic component for all models, the prediction performance improvement gradually becomes larger as the time step increases; (3) under the same prediction horizon, the prediction performance of all models for 15-minute speed data is generally better than that for 5-minute speed data. Overall, the findings in this paper suggest that the proposed hybrid prediction approach is effective for both statistical and machine learning models in short-term speed prediction.},

Furthermore, an online recursive form of the transition probability matrix is derived, through which the statistical characteristics from the practical driving conditions can be collected.

To solve the existing problems of direct and indirect RL based EMSs, a blended RL algorithm, Dyna, is introduced first. By reusing the actual experience to construct a model online, Dyna integrates direct and indirect RL, and thus has the advantages of both. Furthermore, two novel strategies of backward focusing and prioritized sweeping are incorporated in the Dyna framework, developing the queue-Dyna algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, it's the first attempt of adopting queue-Dyna in the EMS of a HEV. A comparative simulation of direct RL, indirect RL, Dyna and queue-Dyna is implemented, and the results demonstrate the proposed algorithm achieves a great improvement in fast learning and maintains satisfied fuel consumption.

An aggregate anxiety concept is introduced to characterize both the driver's anxiety on the EV's range and uncertain events. A mathematical model is also provided to describe the anxiety quantitatively. The problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with an unknown state transition function. The objective is to find the optimal sequential charging decisions that can balance the charging cost and driver's anxiety. A model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based approach is developed to learn the optimal charging control strategy by interacting with the dynamic environment.

Each energy source has different utility function with different preference. Here, we use game-theoretic strategy to dispatch power because it can represent different preferences for different components. In addition, a game-theoretic strategy with velocity prediction (VP) is proposed to improve the basic game-theoretic strategy, ie., game-theoretic management without velocity prediction. Here, a recurrent neural network long short term memory (RNN-LSTM) structure is implemented to predict future velocities. Since the dataset of driving cycles has only one feature, velocity, two different feature engineering methods are proposed to improve the accuracy of VP. Next, Nash equilibrium of game-theoretic management has been realized through the best response functions and the performance of game-theoretic management has been carried out. Finally, four criteria are used to quantify the performance of the proposed energy management and that of the game-theoretic management without VP. A comparative analysis in simulation results validates that the proposed method gives a better performance with less battery power variation, more battery usage power, less engine-generator energy and more UC average energy difference.},

It requires an optimized energy use of internal combustion engine and electric source such as battery, fuel cell, ultracapacitor, etc. In recent years, Reinforcement Learning (RL) based energy management strategy (EMS) has emerged as one of the efficient control strategies. The effectiveness Reinforcement Learning method largely depends on optimized parameter selections. However, a thorough parametric study still lacks in this field. It is a fundamental step for efficient implementation of the RL-based EMS. Different from existing RL-based EMS literature, this study conducts a parametric study on several key factors during the RL-based EMS development, including: (1) state types and number of states, (2) states and action discretization, (3) exploration and exploitation, and (4) learning experience selection. The main results show that learning experience selection can effectively reduce the vehicle fuel consumption. The study of the states and action discretization show that the vehicle fuel consumption reduces as action discretization increases while increasing the states discretization is detrimental to the fuel consumption. Moreover, the increasing number of states improves fuel economy. With the help of the proposed parametric analysis, the RL-based EMS can be easily adapted to other power split problems in a HEV application.},

To obtain the best power distribution between the battery and the ultracapacitor, the reinforcement learning (RL)-based real-time power-management strategy is raised. Firstly, a long driving cycle, which includes various speed variations, is chosen, and the power transition probability matrices based on stationary Markov chain are calculated. Then, the RL algorithm is employed to obtain a control strategy aiming at minimizing the energy loss of HESS. To reduce the energy loss further, the power transition probability matrices should be updated according to the new application driving cycle and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence rate is used to judge when the updating of power management strategy is triggered. The conditions of different forgetting factors and KL divergence rates are discussed to seek the optimal value. A comparison between the RL-based online power management and the rule-based power management shows that the RL-based online power management strategy can lessen the energy loss effectively and the relative decrease of the total energy loss can reach 16.8%. Finally, the strategy is verified in different conditions, such as temperatures, states of health, initials of SoC and driving cycles. The results indicate that not only can the RL-based real-time power-management strategy limit the maximum discharge current and reduce the charging frequency of the battery pack, but also can decrease the energy loss and optimize the system efficiency.},

abstract = {Distributed drive electric vehicles are regarded as a broadly promising transportation tool owing to their convenience and maneuverability. However, reasonable and efficient allocation of torque demand to four wheels is a challenging task. In this paper, a deep reinforcement learning-based torque distribution strategy is proposed to guarantee the active safety and energy conservation. The torque distribution task is explicitly formulated as a Markov decision process, in which the vehicle dynamic characteristics can be approximated. The actor-critic networks are utilized to approximate the action value and policy functions for a better control effect. To guarantee continuous torque output and further stabilize the learning process, a twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is deployed. The motor efficiency is incorporated into the cumulative reward to reduce the energy consumption. The results of double lane change demonstrate that the proposed strategy results in better handling stability performance. In addition, it can improve the vehicle transient response and eliminate the static deviation in the step steering maneuver test. For typical steering maneuvers, the proposed direct torque distribution strategy significantly improves the average motor efficiency and reduces the energy loss by 5.25%–10.51%. Finally, a hardware-in-loop experiment was implemented to validate the real-time executability of the proposed torque distribution strategy.

Energy savings of up to 19% compared with a simulated human driver and up to 11% compared with a fine-tuned Green Light Optimal Speed Advice (GLOSA) algorithm were determined in a probabilistic traffic scenario reflecting real-world conditions.

Battery efficiency was evaluated by the distance traveled per unit battery energy (1% SoC, State of Charge). Mix effect regression was applied to quantify the magnitude and correlation between multiple factors; and 13 machine learning methods were adopted for enhanced prediction and optimization. Although regenerative braking could make a positive contribution to e-bus battery energy recovery, unstable driving styles with greater speed variation or acceleration would consume more energy, hence reduce the battery efficiency. The timing window is another significant factor and the result showed higher efficiency at night, over weekends, or during cooler seasons.

ESG is a weighted combination of multiple base regression models to one meta-regressor, which enhances the model prediction and decreases the model variance over a single regressor model. For the current study, we develop ESG by combining three individual base machine learning algorithms, i.e., Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), to predict the EVs' energy consumption. Tackling the challenge of predicting EVs' energy consumption, the data were collected from Aichi Prefecture, Japan, combining the digital elevation map with long-term GPS tracking data. EVs energy consumption in terms of energy efficiency (kWh/km) was estimated using several important variables such as average trip speed (km/h), trip distance, nighttime lighting, air conditioner (A/C), heater usage ratio, and road gradient. Several statistical evaluation metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods. The prediction results show that ESG is more robust in predicting EVs' energy consumption and outperformed other models by yielding more acceptable values for proposed evaluation metrics. The results further demonstrate that the accuracy of predictive models for EVs energy consumption can be reasonably accomplished by adopting stacking techniques.

abstract = {With the increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs), the demands for rechargeable and high-performance batteries like lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries have soared. Li-ion battery systems require the use of a battery management system (BMS) to perform safely and efficiently. Accurate and reliable battery modeling is important for the BMS to function properly. Currently, many BMS applications use the equivalent circuit model due to its simplicity. However, with the development of a cloud BMS, machine learning battery models can be utilized, which can potentially improve the accuracy and reliability of the BMS. This work investigates the performance of four different machine learning models used to predict the thermal (temperature) and electrical (voltage) behaviors of Li-ion battery cells. A prismatic Li-ion battery cell with a capacity of 25 Ah was cycled under a constant current profile at three different ambient temperatures, and the surface temperature and voltage of the battery were measured. The four machine learning regression models—linear regression, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and decision tree—were developed using the scikit-learn library in Python and validated with experimental data. The results of their performance were reported and compared using the R2 metric. The decision tree-based model, with an R2 score of 0.99, was determined to be the best model in this case study.},

In this work, the traditional Deep Q-Network is compared with the Deep Q-Network with prioritized experience replay. Furthermore, the Deep Q-Network with prioritized experience replay is designed for energy management strategy to minimize hydrogen consumption and compared with the dynamic programming. Moreover, the fuel cell system degradation is incorporated into the objective function, and a balance between fuel economy and fuel cell system degradation is achieved by adjusting the degradation weight and the hydrogen consumption weight. Finally, the combined driving cycle is selected to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in unfamiliar driving environments and untrained situations. The training results under UDDS show that the fuel economy of the EMS decreases by 0.53 % when fuel cell system degradation is considered, reaching 88.73 % of the DP-based EMS in the UDDS, and the degradation of fuel cell system is effectively suppressed. At the same time, the computational efficiency is improved by more than 70 % compared to the DP-based strategy.},

abstract = {The power management system for electronic vehicles selectively activates Electronic Control Units (ECUs) in the electronic control system according to time-series vehicle data and predefined operation states. However, at an operation state transition, the energy overheads used for the selective ECU activation could be higher than the energy saved by deactivating ECUs. To prevent these energy-inefficient state transitions, we apply two main ideas to our proposed algorithm: (A) unacceptable state transitions and (B) adaptive training speed. For the unacceptable transitions, our energy model evaluates the breakeven time where energy saving equals to energy overheads. Based on the breakeven time, our algorithm classifies training dataset as unacceptable and acceptable event sets. Especially when the algorithm trains neural networks for the two event sets, the adaptive training speed expedites its training speed based on a history of training errors. Consequently, without violating in-vehicle time constraints, the algorithm could provide real-time predictions and save energy overheads by avoiding unacceptable transitions. In the simulation results on real driving datasets, our algorithm improves the energy dissipation of the electronic control system by 5% to 7%.},

The charging problem is first formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP), which has unknown transition probability. A modified long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network is used as the representation layer to extract temporal features from the electricity price signal. The deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, which has continuous action spaces, is used to solve the MDP.

However, when various ITS information is added, the size of the prediction algorithm rapidly increases, which increases a computational time and is difficult to implement to real-time systems. To solve the problem of the increased computational power, this paper proposes a velocity prediction algorithm based on a fuzzy Markov chain. This algorithm, designed for a vehicle driving on a specified route, combines a fuzzy Markov chain and a speed constraint model. The fuzzy Markov chain stochastically predicts an ego-vehicle's speed within a constraint area and solves the problem of increasing algorithm size when adding various pieces of input data. The speed constraint model, which is estimated by empirical matrices, estimates the constraint area used in the fuzzy Markov chain.

The optimal control strategies of CAVs are usually determined for a look-ahead horizon using previewed traffic information. This requires the development of an effective future traffic prediction algorithm and its integration to the CAV control framework. However, it is challenging for short-term traffic prediction using information from connectivity, especially for mixed traffic scenarios. In this work, a novel machine learning enabled traffic prediction method is developed and integrated with a speed optimization algorithm for connected and autonomous electric vehicles. The traffic prediction is based on a hybrid macroscopic traffic flow model, in which the most challenging nonlinear terms are modeled with neural networks (NNs). The traffic prediction method can be readily applied to various mixed traffic scenarios. Information from connected vehicles is used as partial measurement of the traffic states and the rest unknown traffic states are estimated using a state observer. Then, the preceding vehicle's future trajectory is obtained to formulate the car-following distance constraint of the energy optimization problem. In a simulated scenario of 70% penetration rate of connectivity, the NN-based traffic prediction algorithm can reduce the root-mean-square errors of the prediction of preceding vehicle speed by near 50%, compared to the conventional traffic flow model.

One of the key challenges, however, is the strain on power grid infrastructure that comes with large-scale EV deployment. The solution to this lies in utilization of smart scheduling algorithms to manage the growing public charging demand. Using data-driven tools and machine learning algorithms to learn the EV charging behavior can improve scheduling algorithms. Researchers have focused on using historical charging data for predictions of behavior such as departure time and energy needs. However, variables such as weather, traffic, and nearby events, which have been neglected to a large extent, can perhaps add meaningful representations, and provide better predictions. Therefore, in this paper we propose the usage of historical charging data in conjunction with weather, traffic, and events data to predict EV session duration and energy consumption using popular machine learning algorithms including random forest, SVM, XGBoost and deep neural networks. The best predictive performance is achieved by an ensemble learning model, with SMAPE scores of 9.9% and 11.6% for session duration and energy consumptions, respectively, which improves upon the existing works in the literature. In both predictions, we demonstrate a significant improvement compared to previous work on the same dataset and we highlight the importance of traffic and weather information for charging behavior predictions.},

Four machine learning algorithms have been evaluated, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), XGBoost, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). MLP obtained the best accuracy value with an R2 score of 0.85 and RMSE of 115.17 for the model without the weather variables. Meanwhile, SVR outperforms all models using a dataset with weather variables. Overall, MLP and SVR can perform well on both types of datasets. This result is expected to be used as a reference method for energy consumption prediction in the electric vehicle charging infrastructure in Indonesia.},

abstract = {Fuel cell-based hybrid electric vehicles are one of the most promising options to achieve zero-emission city buses. Efficient Energy Management (EM) plays a critical role to make such buses more efficient and practical. In this research, an available all-electric bus consisting of fuel cell (FC) and battery is considered and the efficiency of adding a Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) system to it is assessed. The proposed WPT system is only capable to receive energy in bus stations and use it to supply loads or charge the battery. To this end, the actual data of a city bus, its route and load profile were collected and utilized to ensure a realistic assessment. A full mathematical model of the energy system as well as the constraints governing the management issue is extracted and a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method is used to optimally manage the energy flows for the entire journey. All models are implemented in MATLAB software and the efficiency of the proposed system is investigated from economic and technical aspects. The results illustrate a high efficiency for the proposed WPT technique to be used in actual all-electric city buses.},

abstract = {In this study, a thorough and definitive evaluation of Predictive Optimal Energy Management Strategy (POEMS) applications in connected vehicles using 10 to 20 s predicted velocity is conducted for a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV). The presented methodology includes synchronous datasets gathered in Fort Collins, Colorado using a test vehicle equipped with sensors to measure ego vehicle position and motion and that of surrounding objects as well as receive Infrastructure to Vehicle (I2V) information. These datasets are utilized to compare the effect of different signal categories on prediction fidelity for different prediction horizons within a POEMS framework. Multiple artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms use the collected data to output future vehicle velocity prediction models. The effects of different combinations of signals and different models on prediction fidelity in various prediction windows are explored. All of these combinations are ultimately addressed where the rubber meets the road: fuel economy (FE) enabled from POEMS. FE optimization is performed using Model Predictive Control (MPC) with a Dynamic Programming (DP) optimizer. FE improvements from MPC control at various prediction time horizons are compared to that of full-cycle DP. All FE results are determined using high-fidelity simulations of an Autonomie 2010 Toyota Prius model. The full-cycle DP POEMS provides the theoretical upper limit on fuel economy (FE) improvement achievable with POEMS but is not currently practical for real-world implementation. Perfect prediction MPC (PP-MPC) represents the upper limit of FE improvement practically achievable with POEMS. Real-Prediction MPC (RP-MPC) can provide nearly equivalent FE improvement when used with high-fidelity predictions. Constant-Velocity MPC (CV-MPC) uses a constant speed prediction and serves as a “null” POEMS. Results showed that RP-MPC, enabled by high-fidelity ego future speed prediction, led to significant FE improvement over baseline nearly matching that of PP-MPC.},

First, a detailed vehicle powertrain model of the Prius is built. Second, we use the self-supervised learning model to enrich the reward function. The reward function consists of two parts: internal and external rewards. Finally, to prevent the self-supervised model from falling into the “self-good” situation, a reinforcement learning calibration method is proposed. The vehicle exploration method is more effective because of the enrichment of the reward function. Furthermore, following the characteristics of self-supervised learning, we have also constructed a new driving cycle to verify the generalization ability. Results show that our proposed deep reinforcement learning method based on self-supervised and learning calibration realizes faster training convergence and lower fuel consumption than the traditional policy, and its fuel economy can reach approximately the global optimum under our new driving cycle.},

While various governments promote EVs, people feel “range anxiety” because of their limited driving range or charge capacity. A limited number of charging stations are available, which results in a strong demand for predicting energy consumed by EVs. In this paper, machine learning (ML) models such as multiple linear regression (MLR), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and support vector regression (SVR) were used to investigate the total energy consumption (TEC) by the EVs. The independent variables used for the study include changing real-life situations or external parameters, such as trip distance, tire type, driving style, power, odometer reading, EV model, city, motorway, country roads, air conditioning, and park heating. We compared the ML models' performance along with the error analysis. A pairwise correlation study showed that trip distance has a high correlation coefficient (0.87) with TEC. XGBoost had better prediction accuracy ($\sim$92%) or R2 (0.92). Trip distance, power, heating, and odometer reading were the most important features influencing the TEC, identified using the shapley additive explanations method.},

abstract = {The continued spread of electric vehicles raises new challenges for the supporting digital infrastructure. For example, long-distance route planning for such vehicles relies on the prediction of both the expected travel time as well as energy use. We envision a two-Tier architecture to produce such predictions. First, a routing and travel-Time-prediction subsystem generates a suggested route and predicts how the speed will vary along the route. Next, the expected energy use is predicted from the speed profile and other contextual characteristics, such as weather information and slope. To this end, the paper proposes deep-learning models that are built from EV tracking data. First, as the speed profile of a route is one of the main predictors for energy use, different simple ways to build speed profiles are explored. Next, eight different deep-learning models for energy-use prediction are proposed. Four of the models are probabilistic in that they predict not a single-point estimate but parameters of a probability distribution of energy use on the route. This is particularly relevant when predicting EV energy use, which is highly sensitive to many input characteristics and, thus, can hardly be predicted precisely. Extensive experiments with two real-world EV tracking datasets validate the proposed methods. The code for this research has been made available on GitHub.},

This is also a challenging problem due to dynamic changes of traffic states by many uncertain factors along a traveling route. In this paper, we present an Intelligent Trip Modeling System (ITMS) that was developed using machine learning to predict the traveling speed profile for a selected route based on the traffic information available at the trip starting time. The ITMS contains neural networks to predict short-term traffic speed based on the traveling day of the week, the traffic congestion levels at the sensor locations along the route, and the traveling time and distances to reach individual sensor locations. The ITMS was trained and evaluated by using ten months of traffic data provided by the California Freeway Performance Measurement System along a California Interstate I-405 route that is 26 mi long and contains 52 traffic sensors. The ITMS was also evaluated by the traffic data acquired from a 32-mi-long freeway section in the state of Michigan. Experimental results show that the proposed system, i.e., ITMS, has the capability of providing accurate predictions of dynamic traffic changes and traveling speed at the beginning of a trip and can generalize well to prediction of speed profiles on the freeway routes other than the routes the system was trained on. {\textcopyright}2000-2011 IEEE.},

Traditional approaches rely on standard driving cycles or fuel economy data for energy consumption on a limited number of buses; thus, expanding to large bus fleets at the city level has become challenging. This study uses high-resolution GPS and smart card transaction data to generate each bus driving profile and weight dynamics in a large-scale transit network. Two vehicle activity-based energy consumption models are adopted and calibrated for diesel bus (DB) and electric bus by using the field data of 630 bus routes in Beijing. The average energy consumptions of DBs and electric buses are 43.5 and 14.1 L/100 km, respectively. A gradient boosting regression tree algorithm is presented to examine and rank distinct influential factors on the energy consumption of DBs and electric buses. Heterogenous behaviors are identified: the leading attributes affecting the energy consumption of electric buses and DBs are route characteristics and operational condition, respectively. After computing, the total energy conservation of electrifying all bus fleets is equivalent to 0.87% of daily electricity demand in Beijing. These findings set a good base for further studies on bus fleet replacement, charging infrastructure deployment, and electrified route prioritization.},

The design procedure starts with modeling the parallel HEV as a systematic control-oriented model and defining a cost function. Fuzzy encoding and nearest neighbor approaches are proposed to achieve velocity prediction, and a finite-state Markov chain is exploited to learn transition probabilities of power demand. To determine the optimal control behaviors and power distribution between two energy sources, a novel RL-based energy management strategy is introduced. For comparison purposes, the two velocity prediction processes are examined by RL using the same realistic driving cycle. The look-ahead energy management strategy is contrasted with shortsighted and dynamic programming based counterparts, and further validated by hardware-in-the-loop test. The results demonstrate that the RL-optimized control is able to significantly reduce fuel consumption and computational time.},

abstract = {As an important part of the intelligent transportation system (ITS), short-term traffic prediction has become a hot research topic in the field of traffic engineering. In recent years, with the emergence of rich traffic data and the development of deep learning technologies, neural networks have been widely used in short-term traffic forecasting. Among them, the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), especially the Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) shows the excellent ability of time-series tasks. To improve the prediction accuracy of the LSTM, some research uses the spatial–temporal matrix or Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract the spatial features of the data for the LSTM network to use. In this article, we propose an attention CNN to predict traffic speed. The model uses three-dimensional data matrices constructed by traffic flow, speed, and occupancy. The spatial–temporal features extraction and the attention models are all performed by the convolution unit. Experiments on traffic data at 15-minute intervals show that the proposed algorithm has considerable advantages in predicting tasks compared to other commonly used algorithms, and the proposed algorithm has an improvement effect for cases with missing data. At the same time, by visualizing the weights generated by the attention model, we can see the influence of different spatial–temporal data on the forecasting task.},

abstract = {There is a pressing need to develop accurate and robust approaches for predicting vehicle speed to enhance fuel economy/energy efficiency, drivability and safety of automotive vehicles. This paper details outcomes of research into various methods for the prediction of vehicle velocity. The focus is on short-term predictions over 1 to 10 second prediction horizon. Such short-term predictions can be integrated into a hybrid electric vehicle energy management strategy and have the potential to improve HEV energy efficiency. Several deterministic and stochastic models are considered in this paper for prediction of future vehicle velocity. Deterministic models include an Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) model, a Nonlinear Auto-Regressive with eXternal input (NARX) shallow neural network and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep neural network. Stochastic models include a Markov Chain (MC) model and a Conditional Linear Gaussian (CLG) model. To derive the prediction models, numerous data inputs are used, including internal vehicle data (CAN bus information) and external vehicle data (radar and V2I information). Two data sets representative of real world driving in Ann Arbor, Michigan are used for model development and validation. One of these data sets reflects highway-focused single-car driving, and the other one is representative of a mixed highway/urban three-car connected driving. Time shift, a novel index which reflects the time lag between predicted and actual vehicle speed values, is introduced to assess the prediction accuracy of vehicle velocity. Also, a more standard Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric is used to evaluate the prediction results. In order to improve the vehicle speed prediction accuracy, data augmentation with additional labels is used to cue machine learners on different features present in the driving trajectories. The results show that these artificially augmented labels can significantly improve the prediction accuracy both in terms of MAE and time shift metrics. The results also indicate that deterministic models can provide more accurate performance on average while stochastic models may be less accurate in terms of the average velocity prediction but provide information on the prediction error distribution which can be exploited in stochastic and scenario based model predictive control. Overall, LSTM deep neural networks have been able to achieve the best accuracy in predicting vehicle velocity. For 10 sec ahead vehicle velocity prediction, the LSTM model demonstrates prediction accuracy with MAE of about 1 m/s and time shift of 0 to 4 seconds. The results also suggest substantial benefits in using external vehicle data, indicative of the current traffic situation, for vehicle speed prediction.},

The on-ramp merging control and the PHEV energy management are co-optimized such that the DRL policy directly outputs the power split between the engine and the electric motor.

abstract = {In recent years, the Taiwan government has been calling for the use of public transportation and has been popularizing pollution-reducing green vehicles. Passenger transport operators are being encouraged to replace traditional buses with electric buses, to increase their use in urban transportation. Reduced energy consumption and operating costs are important operational benefits for passenger transport operators, and driving behavior has a significant impact on fuel consumption. Although many literatures or real-world systems have addressed the issues related to reducing energy consumption with electric buses, these works do not involve the records collected from an on-vehicle battery management system (BMS). Accordingly, the results of analyses of existing works lack in-depth discussions, and therefore the applicability of existing works is insignificant. Therefore, in this study, driving data were collected using a battery management system (BMS), and vehicular power consumption was classified according to energy efficiency. Then, decision trees and random forest were applied to construct energy consumption analytical models. Finally, the driving behaviors that influence energy consumption were investigated. A case study was conducted in which a Taichung passenger transport operator's electric bus driving data on urban routes were collected to construct energy consumption analytical models. The data consisted of two parts, i.e., vehicle records and route records. On the basis of these records, we considered the practicability and applicability of the analytical models by transforming the unstructured records into raw data. Passenger transport operators and drivers can leverage the obtained eco-driving indicators for different bus routes for energy savings and carbon reduction.},

The results show that considering all the influencing variables can significantly enhance the prediction performance, but comparatively speaking, the route characteristics contribute the most among the three categories and involving more variables demonstrates greater advantages within the trip length under 20 km. It is also found that the trip length, the number of bus stops and the number of the traffic lights passed rank the top three most influencing factors, while the wet-dry condition is the least one. In addition, the variations under five operation scenarios show similar trend. The trip length and average travel speed are inversely proportional to the specific electricity consumption, while the number of bus stops visited, traffic lights passed, and ambient temperature exhibit a gentle proportional relationship. Moreover, it is suggested to plan the new bus line over 10 km in terms of reducing electricity consumption per kilometre.},

abstract = {Equivalent Consumption Management Strategy (ECMS), a representative energy management strategy for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) derived from Pontryagin's minimum principle, is known to produce a near-optimal solution if the costate or equivalent factor of electric use is appropriately determined according to the driving conditions. One problem when applying the control concept to real-world scenarios is that it is difficult to precisely evaluate the performance of the control parameter before driving is complete, so the costate cannot be determined properly. To address this issue, this study proposes a practical method for estimating an appropriate costate based on Deep Q-Networks (DQNs), which is a reinforcement learning algorithm that uses a Deep Neural Network to evaluate the performances and determine the best control parameter or costate. The control concept benefits vehicle energy management by selecting the control parameter most related to stochastic conditions or future driving information based on artificial intelligence (AI), while optimal control is deterministically conducted by ECMS if the control parameter is given. Simply, only the implicit part of the optimal controller is solved via artificial intelligence. In the simulation results, not only does the proposed control concept outperform an existing ECMS that uses an adaptive technique for determining the costate, but the concept is also very feasible, in that it does not need a model for evaluating the performances.},

The equivalent consumption minimization strategy is a well-known algorithm that can be employed for the energy management of hybrid electric vehicles, based on the concept of the equivalent cost of fossil fuels and electric battery energy. However, in the equivalent consumption minimization strategy approach, a parameter called the equivalent factor should be determined to obtain the optimal control policy. In this study, reinforcement learning based approaches are proposed to determine the equivalent factor. First, we show that the equivalent factor can be indirectly extracted from the reinforcement learning results, using the control action from reinforcement learning for the specific driving cycle. In addition, a novel approach that combines reinforcement learning and the equivalent consumption minimization strategy is proposed, where the equivalent factor is determined based on the interaction between the reinforcement learning agent and driving environment, while the control input is decided by the equivalent consumption minimization strategy based on the determined equivalent factor. A model-based reinforcement learning method is used, and the proposed method is validated for vehicle simulation using a parallel hybrid electric vehicle. The simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve a near-optimal solution, which is close to the global solution obtained with the dynamic programming approach (96.7% compared to dynamic programming result in average), and improved performance of 4.3% in average compared with the existing adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy.},

abstract = {In this paper, a deep Q-learning (DQL)-based energy management strategy (EMS) is designed for an electric vehicle. Firstly, the energy management problem is reformulated to satisfy the condition of employing DQL by considering the dynamics of the system. Then, to achieve the minimum of electricity consumption and the maximum of the battery lifetime, the DQL-based EMS is designed to properly split the power demand into two parts: one is supplied by the battery and the other by supercapacitor. In addition, a hyperparameter tuning method, Bayesian optimization (BO), is introduced to optimize the hyperparameter configuration for the DQL-based EMS. Simulations are conducted to validate the improvements brought by BO and the convergence of DQL algorithm equipped with tuned hyperparameters. Simulations are also carried out on both training dataset and the testing dataset to validate the optimality and the adaptability of the DQL-based EMS, where the developed EMS outperforms a previously published rule-based EMS in almost all the cases.},

abstract = {Driver's anxiety about the remaining driving range of electric vehicles (EVs) has been quite improved by mounting a high-capacity battery pack. However, when EVs need to be charged, the drivers still feel uncomfortable if inaccurate range prediction is provided because the inaccuracy makes it difficult to decide when and where to charge EV. In this paper, to mitigate the EV range anxiety, a new machine learning (ML) method to enhance range prediction accuracy is proposed in a practical way. For continuously obtaining the recent traffic conditions ahead, input features indicating the near-future vehicle dynamics are connected to a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, which can consecutively utilize a relation of neighboring data, and then the output features of the LSTM network with another input features consisting of energy-related vehicle system states become another input layer for deep learning network (DNN). The proposed LSTM-DNN mixture model is trained by exploiting the driving data of about 160, 000 km and the following test performance shows that the model retains the range prediction accuracy of 2 ∼ 3 km in a time window of 40 min. The test results indicate that the LSTM-DNN range prediction model is able to make a far-sighted range prediction while considering varying map and traffic information to a destination.},

abstract = {As Electric Vehicles (EVs) become increasingly popular, their battery-related problems (e.g., short driving range and heavy battery weight) must be resolved as soon as possible. Velocity optimization of EVs to minimize energy consumption in driving is an effective alternative to handle these problems. However, previous velocity optimization methods assume that vehicles will pass through traffic lights immediately at green traffic signals. Actually, a vehicle may still experience a delay to pass a green traffic light due to a vehicle waiting queue in front of the traffic light. Also, as velocity optimization is for individual vehicles, previous methods cannot avoid rear-end collisions. That is, a vehicle following its optimal velocity profile may experience rear-end collisions with its frontal vehicle on the road. In this article, for the first time, we propose a velocity optimization system that enables EVs to immediately pass green traffic lights without delay and to avoid rear-end collisions to ensure driving safety when EVs follow optimal velocity profiles on the road. We collected real driving data on road sections of US-25 highway (with two driving lanes in each direction and relatively low traffic volume) to conduct extensive trace-driven simulation studies. Results show that our velocity optimization system reduces energy consumption by up to 17.5% compared with real driving patterns without increasing trip time. Also, it helps EVs to avoid possible collisions compared with existing collision avoidance methods.},

One novelty of the method is the USAge of fuzzy modeling to eliminate the resolution limitation in vehicle acceleration state definition, classification, and prediction. The method uses Auto-regressive (AR) model to capture vehicle speed datas short term dynamics, and classifies the data into multiple acceleration states by fuzzy membership. In the prediction process, acceleration measurements are mapped to the Markov states by fuzzy encoding, and future acceleration states are predicted by Markov transition. Deterministic speed prediction is calculated from the trained AR models, which are selected by fuzzy state membership similarity.

Accurate on-road vehicle speed prediction is challenging, because an individual vehicle speed is affected by many factors, e.g., the traffic condition, vehicle type, and driver's behavior, in either deterministic or stochastic way. This paper proposes a novel data-driven vehicle speed prediction method in the context of vehicular networks, in which the real-time traffic information is accessible and utilized for vehicle speed prediction. It first predicts the average traffic speeds of road segments by using neural network models based on historical traffic data. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are then utilized to present the statistical relationship between individual vehicle speeds and the traffic speed. Prediction for individual vehicle speeds is realized by applying the forward-backward algorithm on HMMs. To evaluate the prediction performance, simulations are set up in the SUMO microscopic traffic simulator with the application of a real Luxembourg motorway network and traffic count data. The vehicle speed prediction result shows that our proposed method outperforms other ones in terms of prediction accuracy.},

Energy consumption estimation is crucial to address these challenges as it provides the foundations to enhance charging-station deployment, improve eco-driving behaviour, and extend the EV cruising range. We propose an EV energy consumption estimation method capable of achieving accurate estimation despite insufficient EV data and ragged driving trajectories. It consists of three distinct features: knowledge transfer from Internal Combustion Engine/Hybrid Electric Vehicles (ICE/HEV) to EVs, segmentation-aided trajectory granularity, time-series estimation based on bidirectional recurrent neural network.

abstract = {With the development of artificial intelligence, there has been a growing interest in machine learning-based control strategy, among which reinforcement learning (RL) has opened up a new direction in the field of hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) energy management. However, the issues of the current RL setting ranging from inappropriate battery state of charge (SOC) constraint to ineffective and risky exploration make it inapplicable to many industrial energy management strategy (EMS) tasks. To address this, an adaptive hierarchical EMS combining heuristic equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) knowledge and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) which is a state-of-the-art data-driven RL algorithm is proposed in this work. For comparison purposes, the proposed strategy is contrasted with dynamic programming (DP), PID-based adaptive ECMS, rule-based and standard RL-based counterparts and the results show that the fuel consumption after SOC-correction for the proposed strategy is very close to that of the DP-based control and lower than that of the other three benchmark strategies. Considering the proposed strategy can make better use of the RL techniques while realizing an effective, efficient and safe exploration in a data-driven manner, it may become a strong foothold for future RL-based EMS to build on, especially when the controller has to be trained directly and from scratch in real-world environment.},

The aim of re-training is to customize the control strategy to a user-specific driving behavior without human intervention. The framework is designed to update the control strategy at the end of a driving task. A combination of dynamic programming and supervised machine learning is used to train the control strategy. The trained control strategy denoted as SML is compared to an online-implementable strategy based on the combination of the optimal operation line and Pontryagin's minimum principle denoted as OOL-PMP, on the basis of fuel consumption. SML consistently performed better than OOL-PMP, evaluated over five standard drive cycles. The EUDC performance was almost identical while on FTP75 the OOL-PMP consumed 14.7% more fuel than SML. Moreover, the deviation from the global benchmark obtained from dynamic programming was between 1.8% and 5.4% for SML and between 5.8% and 16.8% for OOL-PMP. Furthermore, a test-case was conducted to emulate a real-world driving scenario wherein a trained controller is exposed to a new drive cycle. It is found that the performance on the new drive cycle deviates significantly from the optimal policy; however, this performance gap is bridged with a single re-training episode for the respective test-case.},

Thus it has been the subject of numerous research studies spanning decades. One of the most challenging aspects of an Optimal EMS is that FE gains are typically directly related to high fidelity predictions of future vehicle operation. In this research, a comprehensive dataset is exploited which includes internal data (CAN bus) and external data (radar information and V2V) gathered over numerous instances of two highway drive cycles and one urban/highway mixed drive cycle. This dataset is used to derive a prediction model for vehicle velocity for the next 10 seconds, which is a range which has a significant FE improvement potential. This achieved 10 second vehicle velocity prediction is then compared to perfect full drive cycle prediction, perfect 10 second prediction. These various velocity predictions are used as an input into an Optimal EMS derivation algorithm to derive an engine torque and engine speed control strategy that improves FE compared to current vehicle operation. Dynamic programming is used as the Optimal EMS because it provides a globally optimal control which is preferable for this investigatory study. The vehicle model used is real world validated and represents a 2017 Toyota Prius Prime operating in charge sustaining mode.

Vehicle energy consumption depends not only on speed but also on a number of external factors such as road topology, traffic, driving style, etc. Obtaining the cost for each link (i.e., link energy consumption) in road networks plays a key role in energy-optimal route planning process. This paper presents a novel framework that identifies vehicle/driving environment-dependent factors to predict energy consumption over a road network based on historical consumption data for different vehicle types. We design a deep-learning-based structure, called DeepFEC, to forecast accurate energy consumption in each and every road in a city based on real traffic conditions. A residual neural network and recurrent neural network are employed to model the spatial and temporal closeness, respectively. Static vehicle data reflecting vehicle type, vehicle weight, engine configuration and displacement are also learned. The outputs of these neural networks are dynamically aggregated to improve the spatially correlated time series data forecasting. Extensive experiments conducted on a diverse fleet consisting of 264 gasoline vehicles, 92 Hybrid Electric Vehicles, and 27 Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles/Electric Vehicles drove in Michigan road network, show that our proposed deep learning algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art prediction algorithms.

First, the powertrain model of the vehicle and the formulas of the energy management strategy (EMS) are introduced. Then, the complete control framework with a nested loop logic is constructed for the EMS. In this control framework, the heuristic experience replay (HER) is proposed to achieve more reasonable experience sampling and improve training efficiency. Besides, the adaptive moment estimation optimization method with the Nesterov accelerated gradient called NAG-Adam is presented to achieve a better optimization effect. Subsequently, the performance of the proposed control strategy is verified by the high-precision driving cycle. The simulation results show that the newly proposed method can achieve faster training speed and higher fuel economy compared to the existing DRL methods and is close to the global optimum. Finally, the adaptability, stability, and robustness of the proposed method are verified by applying different driving cycles.},

abstract = {Limited driving range remains one of the barriers for widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). To address the problem of range anxiety, this paper presents an energy consumption prediction method for EVs, designed for energy-efficient routing. This data-driven methodology combines real-world measured driving data with geographical and weather data to predict the consumption over any given road in a road network. The driving data are linked to the road network using geographic information system software that allows to separate trips into segments with similar road characteristics. The energy consumption over road segments is estimated using a multiple linear regression (MLR) model that links the energy consumption with microscopic driving parameters (such as speed and acceleration) and external parameters (such as temperature). A neural network (NN) is used to predict the unknown microscopic driving parameters over a segment prior to departure, given the road segment characteristics and weather conditions. The complete proposed model predicts the energy consumption with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 12–14% of the average trip consumption, of which 7–9% is caused by the energy consumption estimation of the MLR model. This method allows for prediction of energy consumption over any route in the road network prior to departure, and enables cost-optimization algorithms to calculate energy efficient routes. The data-driven approach has the advantage that the model can easily be updated over time with changing conditions.},

Thus, the corresponding control performance is strongly dependent on the quality of state of charge reference generation. This paper proposes an intelligent equivalent consumption minimum strategy based on dual neural networks and a novel equivalent factor correction, which can adaptively regulate the equivalent factor to achieve the near-optimal fuel economy without the support of the state of charge reference. The Bayesian regularization neural network is constructed to predict the near-optimal equivalent factor online, while the backpropagation neural network is designed to forecast the engine on/off with the aim of improving the quality of equivalent factor prediction. The corresponding neural network training takes advantage of the global optimality of dynamic programming. Besides, the novel equivalent factor correction can guarantee that the electrical energy is gradually consumed along the trip and the terminal battery state of charge satisfies the preset constraints. A series of virtual simulations under a total of nine driving cycles demonstrates that the proposed method can deliver a competitive fuel economy comparing to the optimal solution derived from the dynamic programming, as well as regulating the battery state of charge to reach the desired terminal value at the end of the trip.},

Modelling the remaining range is closely related with modelling the energy consumption of an electric vehicle. The latter remains an open problem due to unknown context data that may apply such as driving trip speed, vehicle load and topographical characteristics. In this work, a regression model is formulated in order to learn, from time/location-variant real driving data, a relationship between the future energy consumption on one side, and the following related factors, which are considered known, on the other side: i) the difference in average velocity between the future and the past ii) the difference in elevation rate between the future and the past and iii) the recent past energy consumption. Experimental results onaround 2000km of discharge trips, demonstrate the effectiveness of the method over a conventional method that is based solely on historic energy usage evidence.

Hence, it is crucial to understand the effect of driving patterns/cycles on the sizing of ESS in order to avoid over/under-sizing. In this context, we investigate the effect of driving cycle uncertainties on the optimal sizing of ESS in EVs. We specifically focus on the uncertainty arising from the unpredictability of the future state of speed and acceleration and model the same as a scaling factor on velocity-magnitudes and time-windows of the velocity profile. Subsequently, (i) we derive the quantitative relationship between uncertainty and corresponding change in ESS size based on four thousand test driving cycles; (ii) we develop a framework which provides a guideline towards the choice of appropriate sizing of ESS in EVs subject to uncertainty in driving cycle; and (iii) we propose a machine-learning based framework that can enable a data-driven approach for ESS sizing with lower computational requirement.

Energy management of the new hybrid powertrain is an integral component of the overall efficiency of the car and is a prime focus of Colorado State University's (CSU) Vehicle Innovation Team. Previous research has shown that error-less predictions about future driving characteristics can be used to more efficiently manage hybrid powertrains. In this study, a novel, real-world implementable energy management strategy is investigated for use in the EcoCAR3 Hybrid Camaro. This strategy uses a Nonlinear Autoregressive Artificial Neural Network with Exogenous inputs (NARX Artificial Neural Network) trained with real-world driving data from a selected drive cycle to predict future vehicle speeds along that drive cycle. Various prediction windows are analyzed and compared to quantify tradeoffs between prediction window size and speed prediction error for a given drive cycle. To investigate the fuel economy (FE) improvement potential of this new control strategy, a high fidelity model of a Toyota Prius, developed by Colorado State University, is used. An optimal dynamic programming (DP) engine controller is implemented in the Prius model. Several exemplar controllers are studied for the specified drive cycle: the model baseline controller, a DP derived engine controller using NARX Artificial Neural Network speed predictions, and a DP derived engine controller using a 100% accurate speed prediction. These simulations allow for investigation into the tradeoffs between different prediction window sizes. Additionally, the results provide insight into what FE benefit can be expected from speed prediction compared to baseline and idealized conditions. This potentially achievable FE benefit is used as motivation to develop a predictive controller that can be implemented in real-time on the supervisory controller of CSU's Plug-in Hybrid Electric (PHEV) Camaro.},

abstract = {Modern driver assistant systems are responsible for maintaining safe and reliable operation and reducing the energy consumption in electric vehicles since these systems have to possess the capability to predict the expected load. Drive cycles can not fully coincide with real driving behaviour and a one-time test does not reflect the overall traffic and road conditions. The Interval-Type-2 (IT2) Fuzzy System is proved to be a higly efficient tool for modeling uncertainties. In contrast to conventional Type-1 fuzzy modeling an IT2 Fuzzy System has the ability to deal with flexible the various types of uncertainties and modeling errors simultaneously and approximates better real-life systems. This paper presents an Adaptive IT2 Fuzzy System for velocity profile forecasting from the measured velocity and acceleration data. The adaptive driver model is based on Interval Type-2 fuzzy sets. Histograms of input features are used for generating membership functions which parameters are adaptiveley tuned according to the driver's behaviour. Simulation results validate the efficiency and demonstrate that the proposed method is a viable alternative of conventional time series prediction},

@article{Adnane2021,
abstract = {To minimize battery aging of electric vehicles (EVs), it is paramount to manage efficiently their energy consumption. An energy management strategy (EMS) has recently been developed, where batteries and supercapacitors (SCs) are coordinated as a function of the driving mode which is determined manually by the driver. In the present article, we improve the EMS by developing a driving mode predictor (DMP) that determines automatically in real-time the driving mode simply from the speed history of the vehicle. The DMP is designed using supervised learning (SL), a branch of machine learning (ML). A strength of our approach is that it is applicable to predict the driving modes of any EV. To predict the driving modes during a trip made by a given EV, the DMP needs to follow the speed evolution of the EV and know its maximum reachable speed. The integration of the DMP into the EMS results in an enhanced EMS called DMP-based EMS that determines automatically in real-time the power to take from each source of energy of the EV as a function of its speed history. The results obtained from real driving cycles confirm the prediction quality of the DMP and the energy efficiency of the proposed DMP-based EMS.},

@article{Abdelaty2021,
abstract = {The energy consumption (EC) of battery-electric buses (BEB) varies significantly due to the intertwined relationships of vehicular, operational, topological, and external parameters. This variation is posing several challenges to predict BEB's energy consumption. Several studies are calling for the development of data-driven models to address this challenge. This study develops and compares seven data-driven modelling techniques that cover both machine learning and statistical models. The models are based on a full-factorial experimental design (n = 907,199) of a validated Simulink energy simulation model. The models are then used to predict EC using a testing dataset (n = 169,344). The results show some minor discrepancies between the developed models. All models explained more than 90% of the energy consumption variance. Further, the results indicate that road gradient and the battery state of charge are the most influential factors on EC, while driver behaviour and drag coefficient have the lowest impact.},
